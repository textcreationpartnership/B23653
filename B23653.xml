            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the intellience of all their Divisions,
<pb facs="tcp:205314:4"/>Truces, and Alliances, I frame this discourse which shall consist of five Chapters.</p>
            <p>In the first, The whole state of <hi>Europe</hi> shall be set down, the severall Princes thereof, their Religion, and what neighbourhood and dependance they have among themselves.</p>
            <p>In the second, It shall be examined by what degrees the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is entred into the Empire, and into all those great estates which she now enjoyeth by her two Branches of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third, The differences between the two Crowns shal be discuss'd; what right the House of <hi>France</hi> hath in <hi>Catalonia, Portugal, Navarra, Naples, Milan, &amp;c.</hi> Also what claim the House of <hi>Austria</hi> hath to <hi>Burgundy, Brittain Provence, &amp;c.</hi> These are those disputable Rights which have begot so many Divisions and Wars between the Princes, and an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable hatred between the Nations.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter, The businesses shall be presented, which past between the two Kingdoms, from the Treaty of <hi>Arras,</hi> in the year 1435. to the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> in 1598. Wars, Battels, Treaties, Truces, and Peaces.</p>

                     <hi>Europe,</hi> the least of the three parts of the world known to the ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and the most Northerly, but the most populous, and that within which almost all Christendom is comprehended, hath on the South the Mediterranean Sea, and part of the Ocean, and begins at the <hi>Cap. St. Vincent,</hi> in the extremity of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Algarba,</hi> near the Strait of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where the Mediterranean Sea begins, which takes several names, as it toucheth upon severall Provinces, as <hi>Spain, France, Italy, Sicily, Greece.</hi> The Isle of <hi>Candie</hi> is the utmost of <hi>Europe</hi> that way, and it is divided from <hi>Africa</hi> by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea.</p>
                  <p>Eastward ascending to the North, <hi>Europe</hi> is bounded again by the Mediterranean Sea, under the names of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, called now <hi>Archipelago, Hellospont</hi> now <hi>Burdanelles,</hi> or the <hi>Strait of Gallipoli, Propontis</hi> now <hi>Mar de Marmora, Bosphorus, Thracius</hi> now <hi>the Strait of Constantinople, Pontus Euxinus</hi> now <hi>the black Sea,</hi> or <hi>Mar major.</hi> Higher it is bounded by <hi>Meotides Paludes,</hi> and the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> now

                     <hi>Don,</hi> remounting to its spring. And thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward a line is imagined drawne to the North, butting either at the <hi>Golph of St. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> or some such other place thereabout, in the great Duke of <hi>Moscovia's</hi> Country: for that nothern Tract unknown to ancient Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers is yet so little knowne, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>Europe</hi> that way, could never be well assigned.</p>
                  <p>On all the East-side, Europe neighboureth upon the great <hi>Asia,</hi> and is Occidentall to it.</p>
                  <p>On the North-side, ancient Geographers have set no limits to <hi>Europe,</hi> but have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended these Nothern extremities either under the name of <hi>Hyperborean hills,</hi> although there be no hills in that Tract; or under the name of <hi>Mare Glaciale</hi> or the frozen Sea, which we may take from the <hi>Golph of St. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas;</hi> or the mouth of the River <hi>Oby,</hi> unto the Sea which is about <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Finmarch,</hi> and so towards the Isles of <hi>Freezland</hi> and <hi>Island.</hi> On that side, <hi>Europe</hi> buts upon the Pole, and is not near any considerable Lands, some few Ilands onely, ill inhabited, as <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and <hi>Niewland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the West-side, <hi>Europe</hi> hath the great Ocean, from the Iles of <hi>Freesland</hi> and <hi>Is-land,</hi> to the <hi>Cap of St. Vincent,</hi> which is the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Portugal.</hi> And that Ocean takes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

                  <p>These are the limits, and as it were the four walls which inclose all that is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the name of <hi>Europe.</hi> The length whereof may be taken from the <hi>Cap St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> to the <hi>golph S.

Upon the coasts of the Tuscan Sea, he hath <hi>Final, Piombino, Porto Hercule,</hi> and <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello.</hi> Of late, the Prince of <hi>Monaco</hi> hath sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off his yoak. In Toscana, the great <hi>Duke of Florence</hi> doth him homage for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Siena,</hi> and oweth him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that Sea about <hi>Italy,</hi> he hath the Isles of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and is soveraign of the Isle of <hi>Malta</hi> (which the old Geographers reckon among the <hi>African</hi> Ilands). <hi>The great Master</hi> of that Iland, oweth him some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the Celtique Gaule he hath the <hi>Franche County,</hi> or the County of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and in the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy,</hi> he hath the <hi>County of Charrolois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the Belgique Gaule, he hath possest, till the end of the last age, all that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the name of the seventeen Provinces. He keeps to this day the Dutchies of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> &amp; <hi>Limburg,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> but pared about by the losse of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stritcht, the Bose Breda and Bergupzom;</hi> part of the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, Hainant, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> all maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the losse of some limbs, by our late
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205314:7"/>Wars. Also the <hi>Marquisat of the holy Empire,</hi> which is <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the Principality of <hi>Mechlen:</hi> The remnant of these seventeen Provinces, is in the hand of the States of the united Provinces, besides that which the King of <hi>France</hi> hath taken.</p>
                  <p>In all that large extent of Lands, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> suffereth the exercise of no Religion but the Roman. Though he go for a great sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, yet many of his Lands depend from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Princes. The See of <hi>Rome</hi> hath great pretences upon the soveraignty of <hi>Arragon:</hi> He acknowledgerh without contradiction, the soveraignty of the Church over his Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Yet it is pretended that he oweth the same homage for <hi>Sicily.</hi> For the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and other Lands, which he holds in <hi>Italy,</hi> he must acknowledge the <hi>Empire,</hi> from which he hath received the investiture of the same. <hi>Franche County,</hi> is an imperiall fee; as also the Provinces of <hi>Netherland</hi> not depending of <hi>France,</hi> did owe homage to the Empire: And in the year 1608. when the truce was made between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> these two States disputing of their soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the first <hi>Article,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> framed an opposition against that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and claimed the soveraignty as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Empire,</hi> but the Treaty past without any reflection to that claim. Finally, although
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205314:7"/>the <hi>Spaniard</hi> acknowledge our Kings no more, neither for <hi>Flanders</hi> nor for <hi>Artois,</hi> it is not well resolved yet, by what right he hath shaken off the yoak; and the <hi>French</hi> pretend that the Treaties of <hi>Madrid, Cambray,</hi> and <hi>Crespy</hi> in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> which contain that cession, have not been authorized by the generall States of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of Spain being possessor of such a great extent of Lands, is a neighbor to most of the Christian Princes, as will be shewed more at large in the second Chapter, and hath alwaies some difference with them. The now King of <hi>Spain,</hi> is <hi>Phillip</hi> the IV. of the Roman Religion.</p>

                     <hi>Paragraphe</hi> III.</head>
                  <p>Here we will look upon the King of <hi>France,</hi> whose state is comprehended in the old <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Narbonensis, Aquitanica, Celtica,</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gica;</hi> yet doth he not possess them all: the whole <hi>Narbonensis</hi> belongs to him, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Avignon, Nice, Savoy, Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Orenge.</hi> The whole <hi>Aquitanica</hi> is his, since the small principality of <hi>Bearn</hi> (which with small rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath been pretended to be soveraign in her Rights and Customs) hath been united to the Crown, and began to have the same Prince, by the coming of <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> to the Crown. The whole <hi>Celtica</hi> belongs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the King of <hi>France,</hi> excepting onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205314:8"/>the <hi>Franch County,</hi> and the imperial Town of <hi>Besancon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Belgica,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> hath the least part, <hi>The Ile of France, Pays de Caux Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois, Picardi, Beau-voisis Champagne, Brie;</hi> And by good or bad title, the Towns of <hi>Mets, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun;</hi> of which in the first inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he declared himselfe Protector onely. By the late Wars, he hath made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of most part of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of the Town of <hi>Brisach,</hi> and of other Towns of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The subjects of the King of <hi>France,</hi> are commonly Roman Catholiques, yet Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are tolerated in the State.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is neighbouring upon <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Pyrenean hills. On that side the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled one another but of late yeares, in which the <hi>French</hi> have unfortunately attempted <hi>Spain</hi> about <hi>Fontarabie;</hi> but fortunately about <hi>Roussillon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> But about the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and <hi>Franche County,</hi> which lie open to both the Nations, there hath been much stir and action.</p>
                  <p>On the side of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is neighbour to <hi>France;</hi> for <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont</hi> joyn to the foresaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.

                     <hi>Daulphine,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> touch the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Geneva.</hi> By the Country of <hi>Bresse,</hi> and the <hi>Bailliages of Gez and Verromey,</hi> they enter within <hi>Switzerland,</hi> into the Canton of <hi>Berne.</hi> By <hi>Champagne</hi> they have the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> for their neighbour; but now they are possest of his Country. So all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are weak, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> excepted. The present King of <hi>France,</hi> is <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. of the Roman profession.</p>

                  <p>In this Paragraphe we will set downe all the Princes contained within the ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> besides the King of <hi>France.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The City of <hi>Geneva</hi> with her Territory,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205314:9"/>made her selfe a soveraign Common-wealth about the year 1535. when the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> being in contention about their right, the Citizens changed Religion, forced the Bishop to fly, and shut their Gates against the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</hi> But indeed that Towne, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States, were pieces depending from the Empire. But the <hi>Emperours</hi> power being by succession of time confined within <hi>Germany</hi> onely, retain almost nothing out of it, but the shade of their ancient authority.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the <hi>Celtique Gaule, Franch County</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. To these adde many pieces about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which are held to be parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> as the County of <hi>Montbeliard,</hi> which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have bought of late years of the Dukes of <hi>Wirtinberg. Alsatia</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which did belong to the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and consisteth of imperial Towns, and other Towns which the King of <hi>France</hi> now holds. Then the <hi>Palatinate</hi> on this side of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which is now partly in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> partly in that of the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Protestants.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Duke, is now almost altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the King of <hi>Frances</hi> his hands.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The principality of <hi>Liege,</hi> is depending from the Bishoprick thereof.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides these six considerable Princes, there are some of a lower forme.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides these, two estates are attributed to <hi>Italy,</hi> though far from it; the one is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Ragousa</hi> in <hi>Slavonia,</hi> upon the <hi>Golph,</hi> in old time called <hi>Epidaurus.</hi> It is sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, yet payeth to the Turk her next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a tribute of fifteen thousand Sequins yearly.</p>

                  <p>Being now come to the West, we meet with the most considerable piece of <hi>Europe,</hi> which is the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Empire</hi> begun by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> but founded by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> possest all the known Countries of the West. But was greatly diminished about the year of our Lord 400. for then by the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Goths, Ostrogoths, Alans, Huns, Herules, Vandales, Frankes,</hi> and others; many States were founded. And finally, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ceased in the West, altogether in the year 445. by the death of <hi>Augustulus,</hi> and the whole Empire of the West was divided into many States.</p>
                  <p>In the year 800. the <hi>Empire of the West</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun afresh in the person of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> who under that name, possest all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> almost all <hi>Italie,</hi> the great <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Hungary, Slavonia,</hi> part of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other Northern Countries. But his posterity having degenerated, that Empire went from his Family about the year 912. and after a long dispute about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes, <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> made himself Master of it: And from that time, that which remains of the Empire, hath continued in the hands of <hi>German</hi> Princes.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:205314:15"/>
                  <p>That which is called the <hi>Empire</hi> at this day, hath more shadow then substance. I call a shadow all the pretences of the Emperour out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which are worn out with age and lost, or remain with small vigour, as the pretences of Soveraignty over the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries, Savoy, Franche County, Besançon</hi> and the like. In <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> he hath some reall and effective power. <hi>Germany</hi> at this time comprehends all that Country between the border of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> on the East, the <hi>Baltique Sea</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> on the North, the <hi>Germanique Sea</hi> and <hi>France</hi> on the West, and the River of <hi>Rhine.</hi> and the <hi>Alpes</hi> on the South. Neither is the Emperour absolute every where, or in the most part of that large space. For it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ten Circles, or great Provinces, which have a proper right to assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to look to their own businesses, and send Deputies to the generall Diets of the Empire. And in every one of these Circles, there be many free Cities, and many Secular and Ecclesiasticall Princes.</p>
                  <p>The chief are the <hi>seven Electours,</hi> three Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, the Archbishops of <hi>Mentz, Collen,</hi> and <hi>Treues;</hi> four secular, the <hi>Count Palatine, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Saxony,</hi> and <hi>the Marquesse of Brandenhurg.</hi> And next to these the Duke of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Wirtenberg, Luneburg, Mechelburg, Brunswick,</hi> the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> and many others. But above all these houses, that of <hi>Austria</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, of which we must speak in the next Chapter; for, besides the title of Emperour by election, now continued in their family for many descents; they possesse their antient Patrimony, <hi>Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, Carnia, Tirolis, Elzas.</hi> They hold also <hi>Bohemia</hi> and that little part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which remains unto the Christians. All <hi>Germany</hi> is divided between <hi>Papists, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calvinists.</hi> These three and the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion, are the principall Religions known in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IT is certain, that among the Christian Princes, the two most considerable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are those of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be known that the house of <hi>France</hi> hath all the Prerogatives of Antiquity, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Glory above the other; yet that of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205314:16"/>
                  <hi>Austria</hi> is more powerfull for extent of Lands, and multitude of People; and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with a more eminent quality, which is the Empire. But, because they hold it only by Election, they have that preheminence but for a time; so that the Family of <hi>Austria</hi> from a Soveraign, may become a Subject; which can never happen to the Soveraignes by succession, but by the ruine of the State.</p>
               <p>Now, because these two Families draw to their motion, the most part of our Christian Western world, and that since one hundreth and fifty years the house of <hi>Austria</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a stupendious growth: It will be to good purpose to examine in this Chapter her Birth, Progresse, and Greatnesse. For we shall not need to speak of the greatnesse of <hi>France,</hi> which is a grounded Monarchie of twelve hundred years standing. But it is but of late that the house of <hi>Austria</hi> dareth claim equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the house of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>Yet so much we will say of the house of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain that this Kingdome was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected out of the ruines of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the year 419. <hi>Pharamond</hi> was elected King by the <hi>Frankes,</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205314:17"/>Country of <hi>Sicambria,</hi> which is <hi>Guelderland, Uretcht, Freeseland,</hi> and other Countries thereabout. But neither he, nor his Son <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi> the <hi>Chevelu,</hi> past ever into <hi>France</hi> for any thing that we read; but sent forth their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to conquer it. <hi>Merovee</hi> the third King, was the first that came to <hi>Paris</hi> and took it, and setled himself with the <hi>Frankes</hi> in <hi>Gauls.</hi> From him was the first race of French Kings denominated, and called the race of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovingians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Clouis</hi> the fifth King, was converted to the Christian faith in the year of Christ 500. and brought the French State to great splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, by the expulsion of the reliques of the Romans, near <hi>Soissons, Laon,</hi> and <hi>Reims,</hi> by the Conquest of <hi>Gaule, Aquitanique,</hi> and by the defeat of <hi>Alaric,</hi> and the Kingdome of the <hi>Goths.</hi> The Sons of that <hi>Clouis</hi> about the year 527. conquered the state of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> or <hi>Bourguignons:</hi> So that race of the <hi>Merovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> about the year of 530. was possest of all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> yet divided into <hi>Tetrarchies</hi> by the children of <hi>Clouis,</hi> and again by their descent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That race with the <hi>Gauls</hi> held great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and having done great services to the Church, and protected desolate Popes, got from them the name of <hi>most Christians, &amp; eldest Sons of the Church.</hi> When that title was given
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205314:17"/>them, we cannot precisely tell; yet Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> who lived in the year 600. saith, that the King of <hi>France</hi> is as eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Kings, as every King is above his Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That first race kept long the fiercenesse of German-barbarousnesse, and about the year 650. after the death of <hi>Dagobert,</hi> they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to idlenesse, and so continued for a hundred years, which gave occasion to the <hi>Mayres of the Palace,</hi> to incroach upon the Soveraign Authority. Among whom <hi>Charles Martel</hi> was most eminent, who having defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sarrasins</hi> near <hi>Tours,</hi> and killed three hundred threescore and six thousand men, and relieved the <hi>Pope</hi> against the <hi>Lombards;</hi> raised much the honour of <hi>France</hi> and his own, but to the destruction of the first Royal line, which ended in the degradation of the unfortunate <hi>Chilperic,</hi> in the year 752. having subsisted 333 years.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The second race much more illustrious then the first, began in the person of <hi>Pipin,</hi> Son to that <hi>Charls Martel.</hi> A valorous &amp; fortunate Prince, devoutly addicted to the Roman See. He received Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the first into <hi>France,</hi> and put down <hi>Adolphus King of the Lombards,</hi> who persecuted the Pope. But his Son <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne</hi> raised the State of <hi>France</hi> more then any. For he conquered great part of <hi>Italie</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205314:18"/>the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and quite destroyed them <hi>An.</hi> 774. overcame the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Germany,</hi> conquered part of <hi>Spain</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and made himselfe master of most part of the old Empire of the West, and so was crowned <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>West, An.</hi> 800. And three years after, limits were set in <hi>Italy,</hi> between the two Empires of <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West; Nicephorus</hi> being then Emperour of the East. And the bounds were the Rivers of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> now <hi>Garigliano,</hi> and <hi>Aufidus</hi> now <hi>Lofan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> both in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> So that excepting the farthest part of <hi>Italy,</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Brittanique Ilands, divided between many petty Kings, he was possest of the whole Empire of the West.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. These first Kings were very liberall to the See of <hi>Rome. Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> gave them the <hi>Exarchat</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and other Lands which the Popes pretended to have been taken away from them by the <hi>Lombards. Lewis the Meek,</hi> who succeeded his Father <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> confirmed and amplified that gift <hi>An.</hi> 817. the Charter whereof <hi>Baronius</hi> hath published, taken from the <hi>Vatican,</hi> as he affirmeth. <hi>Lewis the Meek</hi> dying <hi>An.</hi> 840. left the State of <hi>France</hi> in a great height, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of the <hi>Gaules, Germany, Italy,</hi> and part of <hi>Spain.</hi> All other Princes compared to the <hi>French</hi> Kings, were mean fellowes.</p>

These three Brothers for three years contended about their partage, the law of the eldest being not then in use among them, till that cruel bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Fontenay</hi> near <hi>Auxerre</hi> was fought, where above a hundred thousand men were slaine, and especially much Nobility and Gentry whereby the State was weakned, and the Brothers were forced to come to an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement; That <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldest, should have all the Lands beyond the Rivers of <hi>Scaldis</hi> and <hi>Mosa,</hi> as far as the <hi>Rhine,</hi> namely the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>the Low Countries, Liege, Treues, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, Luxemburg, Lorrain, Alsatia,</hi> and others. Also that which lyeth beyond <hi>Saone</hi> and <hi>Rhosne,</hi> namely, <hi>Franch County, Savoy, Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine, Provence.</hi> Also as much of <hi>Italy</hi> as was left to the Emperour of the West, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with the Emperour of the East. This was the share of <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldest, who took with it the Title of Emperour. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Brother, had all that their Father held in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there was called <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> To the third, <hi>Charles the Bald, France</hi> was left, much about as it is at this day, inclosed within the narrow Seas of <hi>England, Scaldis, Mosa, Saone, Rhosne,</hi> the coasts of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> That partage of the three
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205314:19"/>Sons of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Meek, <hi>An.</hi> 843. is the most remarkable date of the <hi>French</hi> History. Then was that great Monarchy cut in shreds, and the greatness of <hi>France</hi> humbled, the name of which remained onely to the proportion of a third part. And from that time, the <hi>French</hi> State thus clipt hath remained with little alteration. Onely we have lost <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> and many times the borders of the Kingdome have been changed towards <hi>Mosa</hi> and <hi>Scaldis.</hi> But in recompence we have got <hi>Daulphine</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> beyond the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bounds.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As by this partage the State of <hi>France</hi> remained very much diminisht, so the <hi>French</hi> Kings lost the name of <hi>Emperours,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> took since. But his Descent being fallen to idlenesse as the first Race; the State of <hi>France</hi> thus shortned, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered among many civill broyles and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, till the year 987. when that race end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having subsisted about 235 yeares.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> head of the third Race, was descended as it is thought, from an ancient House of <hi>Saxony</hi> planted in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> of the race of that other <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikind,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince who so long made head against <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> This third race began to raigne in the year 987. It is that which this day subsisteth, and besides her ancient
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:205314:19"/>Nobility before she was Soveraign, hath now held the soveraignty above 660 yeares, and besides innumerable victories obtained over her neighbours, made great Wars against the Infidels in the East, and in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heretiques in all the Provinces of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, keeping still a great respect to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> All these wayes she hath maintained her selfe in the prerogative of precedence and glory above all others. And although he that beares now the quality of <hi>Emperour,</hi> go before the French Kings, because he retaines the name and place of those great Monarchs of all the West, yet he hath neither right nor pretence over the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> yea, <hi>Mr. de Breves,</hi> in the Appendix of the Negotiation of the <hi>East,</hi> added to the History of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, saith, That in <hi>Henry</hi> the 4ths time, he had the precedence before the Ambassadors of the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> at the <hi>Porta</hi> of the great <hi>Turk,</hi> who judged that the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Christian Princes, in relation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes, were of no consideration at his <hi>Porta,</hi> where the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and the most couragious finds most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Also whereas the King of <hi>France</hi> was then in War with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> he would not give his enemy any advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. Neither do the <hi>Turks</hi> acknowledge the Emperour but as King of <hi>Vienna,</hi> but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205314:20"/>have a great esteem for the <hi>French</hi> Kings. But without insisting upon the History of their third Race now reigning, or making Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks of their glory; we will say that next to the precedence which they give to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour lawfully elected, they have it over all the Soveraigns of Christendom.</p>

                  <p>Now to understand the Origine, progresses, and rising of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> we must observe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Empire which was left (as we said) unto <hi>Lothary,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Lewis the Meeke,</hi> subsisted (though weakly) in the house of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> till about the year 912. when <hi>Lewis</hi> the last of that race being dead, there was a great contention betweene the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, whereby the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was in confusion above fifty years, untill <hi>Otho the Great, Duke of Saxony</hi> invested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of that quality, made himselfe Master of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the onely remaining pieces of the Empire, in the year 963. and ruined all his competitors. This <hi>Otho</hi> I. was Father of <hi>Otho</hi> II. and he of <hi>Otho</hi> III. after whose death the <hi>Germans</hi> assisted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the V. who himselfe was a <hi>German,</hi> took upon themselves the right of creating
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205314:20"/>Emperours. And from that time all that have peaceably reigned have been <hi>Germans,</hi> because the Popes having made themselves Masters of a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> have done their utmost to expell the Emperours out of it, and confine them to <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in <hi>France,</hi> by the idlenesse of the last Kings of the 2d Race, the Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces made themselves Masters of them, and became Dukes and Earles. Likewise the idlenesse of the successors of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in the Empire, and the confusions risen in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> after the extinction of that Race, gave a beginning to so many Fees both Secular and Ecclesiasticall which are now in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Governours having made themselves Lords, and laid the foundation of the great Houses now in being. Which neverthelesse have gone through many changes, some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies being extinct, and some Fees sold, transported, or confiscated. Among these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, one of the chiefe, and indeed the most remarkable at this time, is that of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>French</hi> Kings of the first Race, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing a Kingdom of vast extent, which they divided into <hi>Ostrick</hi> and <hi>Westrick. Ostrick</hi> which by corruption and <hi>French</hi> termination, was called <hi>Austrasie,</hi> was the Eastern part, and comprehended the Countries towards the River <hi>Msa,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and as far
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205314:21"/>as <hi>Hungarie, Westrick,</hi> which by corruption was called <hi>Neustria,</hi> comprehended the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> part, from <hi>Mosa</hi> towards <hi>Britain.</hi> These names were long preserved, even to the age of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and being lost by the new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage between the Children of <hi>Lewis the meek;</hi> yet the name of <hi>Neustria</hi> stuck long to the Western part, which is now called <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> (for <hi>Brittain</hi> was a State by it selfe.) The name of <hi>Ostrick</hi> being lost by the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, remain'd nevertheless to the most Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern part, and the next to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and is that which we call <hi>Austria,</hi> a word corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Ostrick</hi> and <hi>Ostenrick,</hi> and is that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince seated upon <hi>Danubius,</hi> where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall City of <hi>Vienna</hi> stands.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that Country <hi>Otho</hi> the III. about the year 1000 establisht <hi>Leopold</hi> a <hi>Marquis,</hi> that is a keeper of those Marches against the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary excursions of the <hi>Hungarians.</hi> That <hi>Leopold</hi> is the head of the first House of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisses</hi> since Dukes of <hi>Austria</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till a certain <hi>Friderick</hi> who went to the War of <hi>Naples</hi> against <hi>Charles</hi> brother of <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> and being taken with <hi>Conradin</hi> a competitor of that Kingdom, was beheaded with him.</p>
                  <p>By his death without Children, <hi>Austria</hi> returned to the Empire. But <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> sought to joyne it to his State, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205314:21"/>sent thither his Sonne <hi>Ottocarus,</hi> who having conspired against the Empire with the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> was degraded and put to death by the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> of whom we are now to speak.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the death of the Emperour <hi>Friderick</hi> the Second, the great enemy of Popes, which was about the year 1231. the factions were so great about a new election, that there was an Anarchy of twenty years and above, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these titular Emperours, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, Richard</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the end, after many assemblies and contentions, the Electors gave their Votes to <hi>Rudolphus</hi> Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> who was acknowledged by the whole Empire. That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was in the year 1255. five years after the death of St. <hi>Lewis. Philip le Hardy</hi> then raigning in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Between <hi>Basel</hi> and <hi>Soleurre,</hi> Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> there is <hi>Triestein</hi> Castle, the Lords whereof had the Title of <hi>Counts,</hi> and by the women inherited the County of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> and took the Title of the same. Of that House was this <hi>Rodolphus</hi> (before whom there is no certainty of the History of their House) who by his virtue was elected Emperour, <hi>An.</hi> 1275. and dyed in the 1291. The Dutchy of <hi>Austria</hi> being then vacant, and <hi>Ottocarus</hi> the <hi>Bohemian</hi> having invaded it, and made a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:205314:22"/>league with the <hi>Hungarians</hi> against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> divested him of it, and slew him; and <hi>An.</hi> 1282. invested his Son <hi>Albert</hi> in the same. In that <hi>Albert</hi> we must take the birth of the house of <hi>Austria.</hi> And although that <hi>Albert</hi> was also Emperour from the year 1298. till 1308; yet his descent return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to that quality, but 130. years after, and went for Princes of the Empire, as other Imperial Families; Onely in the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. there was a great contention for the Empire, between <hi>Friderick</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavieres.</hi> The whole Pedegree of that house, is to be seen in the Tables of <hi>Bertius,</hi> from the Creation of <hi>Rudolphus</hi> of <hi>Habsburg, An.</hi> 1275. to the year 1438. when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire entred so into that house, that it did not come out since.</p>

                  <p>From that year these Emperours reigned. <hi>Albert</hi> the II. who reigned two years, <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the III. his Cozin who reigned 53 years. <hi>Maximilian</hi> Son of <hi>Friderick,</hi> who reigned 26 years. <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who reigned 36 years. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> I. brother to <hi>Charles,</hi> who reigned 9 years. <hi>Maximilian</hi> Son of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> who reigned 12 years. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> II.

The house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was founded in the person of <hi>Philip,</hi> fourth Son to <hi>King John</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who dying in the year 1363. left to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He and his three Successours, <hi>John, Philip the Good,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> slain before <hi>Nancy,</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many Provinces by Marriages, Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Gifts, and Usurpations; whence that great Estate of the house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, four main pieces whereof depended from the Soveraignty of <hi>France:</hi> Namely, the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Lilo, Doway,</hi> and <hi>Orches,</hi> the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> and that of <hi>Charalois.</hi> The rest he held from the Empire, <hi>Franch County,</hi> the four Dutchies of <hi>Netherlands, Luxemburg, Limburg, Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Gueldres.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Hainault, Namur, Holland, Zealand, Zutfen, Mechlen, West-Fresland, Over-Issel,</hi> and <hi>Groninghen.</hi> And in the year 1528. the Bp. of <hi>Utrecht</hi> yielded to the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the V. the Lordship of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and his claim in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:205314:25"/>
                     <hi>Over-Issel,</hi> because he was not strong enough to maintain it against the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guelders</hi> his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Charles,</hi> killed before <hi>Nancy, Mary</hi> his onely Daughter, pretended to his whole succession; But <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. King of <hi>France,</hi> seized upon the Dutchy of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> pretending that it was a masculin fee, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>King John</hi> to his Son <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> for him and his Heirs Male; for the reasons which we shall represent in the following Chapter. All the rest by right remained with <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> even the County of <hi>Charo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> almost inclosed within the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> although the French would have it to be a fee of the same Nature, as the Dutchy. Yet because it was found that it had been purchased from the house of <hi>Armagnae,</hi> by the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it was left to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> And since that time, during the civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, and the Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> the French having seized upon it; yet they restored it to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins, Ann.</hi> 1598. saving onely the resort and dependance upon the Parlament of <hi>Dijon</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The house of <hi>Castilia</hi> is an offspring of that of <hi>Navarra:</hi> For <hi>Sanchez</hi> King of <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> divided all that he held in <hi>Spain</hi> to his three children. <hi>Garcias</hi> the eldest had <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:205314:25"/>Sanchez</hi> King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> divided all that he held in <hi>Spain</hi> to his three Children, <hi>Garci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the eldest had <hi>Navarra; Ferdinand, Castilia;</hi> and <hi>Ramires, Arragon.</hi> Of these Kings, the lives and actions must be seen in the History of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the year 1472. that House fell to <hi>Isabella,</hi> sister to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. called the <hi>Impotent. Isabella</hi> was married to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> From that marriage issued <hi>Joane</hi> the second Daughter and Heir, which brought all these Estates to the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> by her marriage with <hi>Archiduke Philip.</hi> These Estates contained the two <hi>Castilia's, Gallicia, Leon, Asturia, Biscay, Mursia, Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Andalusia, Estremadura.</hi> Since that time <hi>an.</hi> 1492. under the conduct of <hi>Christophorus Columbus,</hi> the <hi>Castilians</hi> discovered many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of West-Indies, <hi>Hispaniola, Cuba, Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and others. <hi>Americus Vespucius,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Western continent, <hi>an.</hi> 1500. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Cortez,</hi> subdued the great State of <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, an.</hi> 1518. and <hi>Francis Pizarro</hi> the <hi>Perou, an.</hi> 1525. All that, is comprehended under the name of <hi>Castilia,</hi> and is fallen to the House of <hi>Austria</hi> by that marriage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for <hi>Arragon,</hi> many Kings reigned in it of the line of the foresaid <hi>Ramires,</hi> and that family past through many changes. In the end that estate fell into the hands of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the <hi>Catholique,</hi> at the same time that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205314:26"/>the Kingdom of <hi>Castilia</hi> fell to <hi>Isabella</hi> whom he married. So his estate came to consist of four parts. 1. Of the patrimoniall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his House, <hi>Arragon, Catalonia, Rous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillon, Valentia, Marjorca, Minorca, Ivica, Fromentera, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> 2. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which he tooke from the <hi>French, An.</hi> 1503. as we shall say afterwards. 3. The Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> which he and his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> got from the <hi>Saracens, Anno</hi> 1494. 4. The Kingdome of <hi>Navarra,</hi> out of which he dispossest <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Albret, An.</hi> 1512. All these Estates fell to his Daughter, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with <hi>Philip</hi> Arch-duke of <hi>Austria.</hi> 5. <hi>Hungary</hi> had her Kings, well known in the Histories, especially since the year 1000. the time of King St. <hi>Steven.</hi> That family fell to that of the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> descended from the Royall House of <hi>France,</hi> by the marriage of the inheritrice of <hi>Hungary</hi> with <hi>Charles the Lame,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles,</hi> brother to St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, after many great changes, that Crown fell to <hi>Lewis</hi> the last King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> slain by the <hi>Turks</hi> in the battel of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hats, An.</hi> 1526. He dying without Children, the Crowne fell to his sister <hi>Anne,</hi> whom <hi>Charles</hi> the V. her brother in law presently caused to be married to his brother <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> So the two Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> entred into the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:205314:26"/>To <hi>Bohemia</hi> were annext also <hi>Moravia, Silesia,</hi> and the two <hi>Lusatia's.</hi> Under the name of <hi>Hungary,</hi> was contained also <hi>Transylvania,</hi> with part of <hi>Bulgaris, Croatia, Slavonia, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi> But the greatest part of these is now in the hand of the Turks.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The State of <hi>Portugal</hi> began about the year 1090. in the person of <hi>Henry,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Prince of the House of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among many changes to the death of King <hi>Sebastian, An.</hi> 1579. after whom in the raign of his great Uncle <hi>Cardinal Henry,</hi> there was a dispute between many contenders for the succession. But <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> got it by Arms, <hi>An.</hi> 1580. claiming right to it by his Mother <hi>Isabella,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> for the reasons which we shal speak of in the next Chapter. From that Kingdom depends that of <hi>Algarba,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Ceuta, Tanger,</hi> and <hi>Marsagan</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> An infinite number of <hi>Ilands</hi> and <hi>Caps,</hi> from the <hi>Cap of good Hope,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Congo, Angola, Bresia;</hi> and beyond the <hi>Capeof good Hope,</hi> an infinite number of Towns, Isles, Countries, and Forts, as far as <hi>China,</hi> and the extremity of the East. All that is comprehended under the name of <hi>East-Indies,</hi> discovered at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times since, <hi>Vasco Gamma,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Portugal</hi> past the <hi>Cap of good Hope,</hi> An. 1497. under <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> It is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205314:27"/>then by the right of <hi>Isabella,</hi> wife to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. that the great Estate of <hi>Portugal</hi> was devolved to the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi> To which Estate they have since added several pieces by conquest or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the V. got the Lordship of <hi>Utrecht</hi> from the Bishop, as we said before. The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to them (as they pretend) by the Treaties of <hi>Madrid,</hi> An. 1525. Of <hi>Cambray,</hi> An. 1529. Of <hi>Crespy,</hi> An. 1544. The same <hi>Charles</hi> got the Town of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> An. 1530. although the Bishop of <hi>Liege</hi> pretended the halfe of it to belong to his jurisdiction. In the year 1530. he invested <hi>Ludovic Sporza</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> upon condition that if he dyed childlesse, <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> should succeed him, which happened five years after, <hi>An.</hi> 1536. he got the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders,</hi> the County of <hi>Zutfen,</hi> and the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Groning,</hi> by a Treaty with <hi>Charles,</hi> the Duk of <hi>Guelders,</hi> who dyed <hi>an.</hi> 1538. <hi>An.</hi> 1543. he made himselfe Master of the Town of <hi>Cambra,</hi> as Protector of that Imperiall Town, which being since got by the <hi>French,</hi> and lost again, was confirmed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Vervins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1538. the same <hi>Charles</hi> having got the Town of <hi>Siena,</hi> gave it to <hi>Cosmo</hi> Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> to be an homage for it to the King of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205314:27"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> paying six thousand Ducats of entry at every change of Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> took from the Turks, <hi>an.</hi> 1554. the Fort of <hi>Pignon, Veles,</hi> and <hi>Gomera,</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> An. 1571. he wrested the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Final</hi> from the House of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto. Philip</hi> the III. took from the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Townes of <hi>Arrach</hi> and <hi>Mamora.</hi> These are the principal pieces of that great State of vast extent. And I think one may truly say, that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> holds more ground then ever any Prince did: But these pieces being scattered, that State is not strong, glorious, and formidable according to its extent.</p>
                  <p>That House of <hi>Austria</hi> was divided into two branches, the <hi>Spanish</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> brothers, and successively Emperours, Sons to <hi>Archiduke Philip,</hi> and <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Spain. Charles</hi> was the head of the Spanish branch, which holds in <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> and out of it all that we said before. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> brother of <hi>Charles,</hi> was the head of the <hi>German</hi> branch which now holds the Empire. To him <hi>Charles</hi> yeelded the ancient patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Estate of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> within the limits of Germany. The same <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by his marriage with <hi>Anne,</hi> inheritrix of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> united those two Crowns to his States. These two Branches at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205314:28"/>hold these Estates, saving that which <hi>Gustavus</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath taken from them, and what the <hi>French</hi> have got in these Warres from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> In the Low Countries, <hi>Hesdin, Arras Bapaume, Landrecy, Thionville, Quesnoy, &amp;c.</hi> Towards <hi>Spain</hi> the County of <hi>Roussillon</hi> and <hi>Perpignan.</hi> Then the <hi>Catalonians</hi> have revolted and given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>French. Portugal</hi> also hath sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the yoak, and chosen a King of the House of <hi>Braganza,</hi> Of elder date, part of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> have cantonned themselves, and are now Soveraigns. The <hi>Turk</hi> hath got the most part of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and <hi>Transylvania</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no more the House <hi>Austria.</hi>

               <p>THe contentions between these two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies these 150 yeares, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions subject unto them, especially the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> comes not onely out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall antipathy and contrary inclinations but chiefly out of the pretences that the one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:205314:28"/>house hath upon the other. For, as between private persons, so among Princes, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of grounds breeds quarrells. And these severall pretences yet undecided, ought to be examined, to know the ground of all the late and present Wars. Of these, large volumes of Histories, and Polemical writings might be, and have been, written; but here I undertake no more, but faithfully to set down the grounds of pretences on both sides. Which though I will do briefly, and summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, yet will I omit nothing essential and fit to decide the differences. To do this order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we will divide this Chapter into two points. The first, of the pretences of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> upon <hi>France.</hi> The second, of the pretences of <hi>France</hi> upon the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi>

                  <head>First Point, <hi>The pretences of the house of</hi> Austria, <hi>upon that of</hi> France.</head>
                  <p>ALthough the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> both the <hi>Spanish</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> have pretences different from that of the Empire, which they hold only by Election, and upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yielding, and depositing it again in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205314:29"/>hands of the Electours, after the death of each Emperour; Yet their interesses are now so united, that the Imperial rights, and those of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> can hardly be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore we will examine them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>All the pretences of that Family, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Soveraignty of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> or part thereof; especially upon the propriety of <hi>Province,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Mets, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> the Towns upon the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Britain.</hi> These must be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

                        <hi>Paragraphe</hi> I.</head>
                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>The pretended Rights of the Empire, upon the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of</hi> France.</head>
                     <p>Concerning that Right, now stale, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ridiculous; four things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Roman Empire which began in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Augustus,</hi> comprehended indeed all the West, and herein the Gaules. That Empire was made up of the ruine of many Nations, by right or wrong. Howsoever long prescription, and the consent of Nations, with the extinction of the royall Families, made up a reasonable right, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:205314:29"/>in the Roman Emperours, till the year of Christ, 400; when by the inudation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Northern Nations; <hi>Goths, Vandales, Franks,</hi> and others; the whole Empire was dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and the severall Conquerors of each part made themselves Soveraign. So did the <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Gaules.</hi> A beginning not to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of violence and usurpation. But the ruine of the Romans, prescription, and the consent of the conquered people did since authorize their dominion, and towards the end of the first age of these invasions, they were all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and the Conquerours remained just possessours, especially when the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ended in <hi>Augustulus, An.</hi> 475.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Charlemagne</hi> restored the Western Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 800. that promotion did not alter the former Title he had to the Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> It was but a Title of honour, which he, and after him his Sonne <hi>Lewis the Meek</hi> possest, with that of King of <hi>France.</hi> Afterwards, by the partage made <hi>An.</hi> 843. between the Sons of <hi>Lewis the Meek;</hi> each of the three brothers had his portion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from the others, and <hi>Lothary</hi> the Eldest, who had the Title of Emperour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no right over <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> who had <hi>France</hi> for his Portion, much as it is now. Since which time, all that would ascribe any Superiority to the Emperours, over the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205314:30"/>Princes of Christendom, that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Soveraign, have with good reason bin hissed out as ridiculous. Only the precedence was left to the Emperour as the eldest among the brethren. But the subjection which he yields to the Pope, and the small right which he retains over the Lands and Princes of the Empire, weaken his authority very much, and make it unworthy of that precedence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Princes of Christendom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not stir those antient pretences over all the Kingdomes of the West.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some Germane Historians, as <hi>Trithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Lazius, Munster, Fiesdorpius</hi> make the house of <hi>Habsbur,</hi> (which is that of <hi>Austria</hi>) to descend from the first race of the French Kings; a fable invented since 120. years, and newly taken up again by the flatterers of that house. Especially by <hi>Fiesdorpius,</hi> a name ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or forged by the Spaniards.</p>
                     <p>To understand this, we must know that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was often divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tetrarchies under the first race, Kings of <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and <hi>Mets.</hi> In the last of these, <hi>Brunehault</hi> reigned with great power, that abominable woman so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in our Histories, which confounded and destroyed that house by her ordinary murthers. That State of <hi>Mets</hi> being fallen into the hands of two brothers, <hi>Thierry</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:205314:30"/>
                        <hi>Theodebert,</hi> who contended for it; <hi>Therry</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his Grandmother <hi>Brunchault,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Theodebert</hi> in battell, and put him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly to death. And by <hi>Brunehaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> order, the two Sons of <hi>Theodebert</hi> were slain in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. This Tragedy was acted <hi>An.</hi> 617. But these Historians, to flatter the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> say, that of these two Sons of <hi>Theodebert,</hi> the one, called <hi>Sigebert,</hi> escaped the hands of his great Grandmother, and fled into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Genebald,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> his Uncles by the Mother, by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession he obtained of <hi>Lothary</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> his Cosin, some lands in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> upon condition that he should renounce all his rights to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> That he or his Son, or one of his more remote descent built the Castle of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> and founded that family. And upon that account, the house of <hi>Austria</hi> descends from that of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That relation is a blind tale; for all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Historians affirm, that both the Sons of <hi>Theodebert</hi> (and he had no more) were slain by <hi>Brunehault.</hi> And the first that mentions that escape of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> is <hi>Trithemius,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about six score yeares ago. And as it is false, it is ridiculous in the ordinary vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the affairs of the world, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall changes of Possessions, to set up Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:205314:31"/>after an interruption of a thousand years. For, upon that account, there is no Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> but may be degraded, and no mean man, but may be intitled to some principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It is with great reason, that the Title of prescription is every where preferred before all Titles. And though the tale were a true story, that <hi>Rodolphus</hi> of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> the head of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> was descended from the Family of <hi>Habsburg</hi> by the women; his mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine extraction was from the house of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estein.</hi> So this pretence is so ridiculous, that it is not worth speaking.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The branch of the house of <hi>Valois</hi> hath continued from male to male from <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> who came to the Crown, <hi>An.</hi> 1328, to the death of <hi>Henry the Third, An.</hi> 1589. males failing in that branch, the Crown by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws of the Land was to pass to the next branch of the Males, which was that of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and so did in the end. A Title so known to all the French, that even in the heat of the War of the League, against the house of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as professing a contrary Religion; yet they crowned the <hi>Cardinal of Bourbon,</hi> and called him <hi>Charles the Tenth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these confusions, <hi>Philip the Second</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> seeing the party of the <hi>League</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Election of a King, claimed the Kingdom for his Daughter <hi>Clara Eugenia
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205314:31"/>Isabella,</hi> as Daughter of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his third wife, sister and Heir of the three last Kings, <hi>Francis</hi> II. <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>and of Francis Duke of Alenson,</hi> the eldest of three Sisters; of which the Second was <hi>Claude,</hi> married to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and the third was Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> wife to <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> then only titular King of <hi>Navarra.</hi> He alleadged then that <hi>representation</hi> being a good Title by the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> his Daughter entred into all the rights of her Mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which should have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of her brothers; and that her right exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded even to the <hi>Crown,</hi> as the Patrimony of her Family; That the pretended <hi>Salique Law</hi> of the French was imaginary; yea, and against Nature, against Humanity, and the right of Political successions, which require that all Inheritances may go to the next Heirs. And though that Law had force among the French, that his Daughter being not a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor borne in <hi>France,</hi> could not be tied by these municipall Laws. That between Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, the Law of Nature, not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws of Nations should be the rule. That all Laws of Nature reject this principle, that the successions should be for males only, as though females were unreasonable creatures; or the excrements and sweepings of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and no part of human society.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:205314:32"/>
                     <p>When the States of the League were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Paris, An.</hi> 1593. some unadvised and rash heads moved the Election of a King, and the excluding of the house of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which stirred the Parliament to make that famous Arrest for the maintaining of the Salique Law, to which the wisest of the <hi>League</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Philip the</hi> II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> in that Assembly of the States, set up his Daughters Title, and presented her to be Queen. But presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the weaknesse of that Title, and the aversion of the French, from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a woman; he offered to marry her ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Prince of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> or with one of the House of <hi>Lorraine;</hi> Whose imaginary rights were at the same time pleaded. And to strengthen all these rights, he said, that the Election by the States would supply all defects in the Right of succession.</p>
                     <p>It appeared, that <hi>Philip</hi> acknowledged the weaknesse of his Daughters right, since he presented her to be elected. The Salique Law is fundamentall in <hi>France,</hi> wisely instituted, and observed twelve hundred years together.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Philips</hi> allegation, that Princes are not to be tied by municipall Laws, but by the Laws of Nature, it is utterly false. For in the discussion of the rights of all Soveraigns, the municipall Lawes are alwaies examined;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205314:32"/>and none can have right to an Estate from which he is excluded by the Law of the Land. The decision of all suits for Estate, is taken out of the customes of the Land where the Estate lyeth; but where those customes written or unwritten are wanting, the case is to be decided by reason onely. The <hi>French</hi> think they have both Law and Reason on their side. Howsoever, that <hi>Isabella</hi> in whose favour that Right was set up, dyed child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, <hi>an.</hi> 1633. Whose right, if she had any, should be devolved since to the Children of her second sister <hi>Katherine,</hi> wife to <hi>Charies E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> from whom all the House of <hi>Savoy</hi> that now is, is descended.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Besides these imaginary Rights to the whole Kingdom, the Empire hath a weake pretended right to some parts of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we must observe, That by the partage between the Sons of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> 843. all the Countries that lye between the Rivers of <hi>Rhosne</hi> and <hi>Saone,</hi> and the <hi>Alpes, viz. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, Daulphine, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Franch County,</hi> remained Imperial Lands. And the <hi>French</hi> Kings in the second Race, yea, and very far in the third Race, pretended nothing to them till <hi>Daulphine</hi> came to them in the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. And that part of the Empire being held by <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Lewis
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205314:33"/>the Meek,</hi> and after him by his Son <hi>Lewis the Young,</hi> who dyed without Heirs Male, a State was erected in favour of his Daughter <hi>Hermengard;</hi> between these two Rivers and the Alpes, which was called the Kingdom of <hi>Arles,</hi> or the second Kingdome of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which continued under its proper Kings (whose pedegree was fully described by the Historian <hi>Du Chesne</hi>) unto the death of <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> the last King, who dying without issue, <hi>an.</hi> 1036. left his Estate to the Emperour <hi>Conrad</hi> the II, surnamed the <hi>Salique,</hi> who had married his sister <hi>Grisel,</hi> or (as some say) was his Nephew by her.</p>
                     <p>By that gift, besides the antient pretence of the Empire upon that Kingdome, at least for the soveraignty, the Emperours became Masters of the same both by soveraignty and propriety, and annext it to the Empire; At which time the Arch-bishop of <hi>Treves</hi> tooke the name of Chancellor, <hi>per regnum Arelaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.</hi> But the Authority of the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a great decay out of Germany, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during the Warres betweene the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and the Popes; four Principalities were framed in that Kingdom of <hi>Arles,</hi> of the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> of <hi>Viennois,</hi> the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Moriurre,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led since <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which without question depended
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205314:33"/>from the Empire as long as there was any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in it: But time hath worne out that title, and prescription is past upon it; not to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the old title revived, unless the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour will together question most part of the Principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the East and North <hi>Gaules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of these four Principalities, that of <hi>Savoy</hi> subsisteth to this day. <hi>Franch County</hi> is fallen to the House of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and so to the house of <hi>Austria. Daulphiné</hi> was given to <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> by <hi>Imbert Dolphin,</hi> about the yeare 1343. And <hi>Provence</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. <hi>an.</hi> 1482. by <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Maine,</hi> Heir to <hi>René</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> All these changes and gifts as for the propriety only, the Soveraignty being still pretended by the Emperours, which they may well be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have lost, by weaknesse, desertion, and by prescription, as many other Principalities at this side of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Besides, the <hi>French</hi> Histories relate that in the year 1377. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the IV, being come into <hi>France</hi> to visit King <hi>Charles</hi> the V, gave to his God-son <hi>Charles,</hi> who since was <hi>Charles</hi> the VI, the right which the Emperours pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Daulphiné,</hi> which was no great gift. And <hi>Theodorick à Niem,</hi> an Historian of that age, saith, That the same Emperour being come to <hi>Avignon</hi> to visit the Pope, gave to

                        <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the V. of <hi>France,</hi> the whole Kingdome of <hi>Arles,</hi> which had been under the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Empire, in recompence of the magnificent entertainment which the said <hi>Lewis</hi> gave him at <hi>Villeneufue</hi> near <hi>Avignon.</hi> So all these Rights of the Empire, are lost ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by prescription or donation. These are all the rights that can be imagined to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Emperours and the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> upon the Soveraignty of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

By the partage betweene the Sonnes of <hi>Lewis the Meek, Provence,</hi> with all that was beyond the Rivers of <hi>Rhosne</hi> and <hi>Saone,</hi> was cut off from the portion, given to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and was since called the Kingdome of <hi>Arles.</hi> All these pieces given to <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldest brother, were called the <hi>Empire,</hi> and Imperial grounds; and to this day the Lands beyond the <hi>Rhone</hi> towards <hi>Italy,</hi> are called <hi>Terres d' Empire,</hi> Lands of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the Lands at this side <hi>Terres de France,</hi> French Lands.

                     <p>The County of <hi>Anjou</hi> returned to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> being given as a portion to <hi>Margaret,</hi> Grand-child to that <hi>Charles,</hi> who was married to <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Valois,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Philip de Valois.</hi> And many yeares after that first Branch of the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Counts of <hi>Anjou,</hi> pretended no right to that County, it was given to <hi>Lewis,</hi> brother to King <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who sounded the second House of <hi>Anjou,</hi> now erected to a Dukedome. But the two other pieces of that Estate, which <hi>Charles</hi> brother to St. <hi>Lewis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with his wife <hi>Beatrix,</hi> which was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and the Kingdom of the two <hi>Sicilies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alwayes united: and the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> whether of the first House of <hi>Anjou,</hi> or of the second, or of the family of <hi>Arragon,</hi> have alwayes claimed a right to the County of <hi>Provence;</hi> so that <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> go under one right, as we shall more

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Jane, Queen of Naples,</hi> of the first house of <hi>Anjou,</hi> went out of <hi>Italie, An.</hi> 1347. with Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and retired to <hi>Avignon</hi> when that great Schism began, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued forty years. Since which time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there have been many disputes for the succession of <hi>Naples,</hi> between the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the house of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and that portion of <hi>Italie</hi> past through many changes; yet <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> into which that <hi>Jane</hi> retired, was soon after put in the hands of <hi>Lewis, first Duke of Anjou,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles the</hi> V. and both he and his descent enjoyed it peaceably, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any disturbance from the houses of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> who were fighting for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> although both pretended that <hi>Province</hi> belonged to them by the same right. But the conveniency of the place, as lying under the wings of <hi>France,</hi> which might assist it at any time, kept the possession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the house of <hi>Anjou.</hi> And finally, from the house of <hi>Anjou</hi> it past to that of <hi>France,</hi> being left to <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. by <hi>Charles Count du Main,</hi> Heir and Nephew to <hi>Rene,</hi> titular King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and reall Possessor of <hi>Province. Lewis the</hi> XI. though he knew the right of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> which his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205314:36"/>VIII. and his other successours have pursued; yet he neglected it, and contented himself to take <hi>Provence.</hi> By this discourse, it appears that who so hath the lawfull Possession of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> (which we shall examine afterwards) hath also a lawfull right to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Besides that claim of the Possessors of <hi>Naples</hi> upon <hi>Province,</hi> disputable between that house first of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and that of <hi>Arragon</hi> &amp; <hi>Austria;</hi> there is a more particular claim of the <hi>Dukes of Lorraine</hi> against the <hi>French</hi> Kings, Heirs to that <hi>Charles du Main.</hi> The <hi>Lorriners</hi> pretend that <hi>René</hi> having a Daughter named <hi>Yoland,</hi> from which the house of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is descended, could not lawfully dis-inherit his Grandchild, to give his Estate to <hi>Charles du Maine</hi> his Nephew. To which the <hi>French</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Province</hi> was a purchase of <hi>René,</hi> who could dispose of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that <hi>Province</hi> useth the Civil or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law, by which testaments are free. But the discussion of that point, is for another place.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever this remains, That the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings after them, have peaceably enjoyed the County of <hi>Province</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 270. years, and the invaders of <hi>Naples</hi> never had any thing in it: Which indeed, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:205314:37"/>not, but that they may have a right to it. But the reason whereby we shall exclude them hereafter from any right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> will serve also to invalid their claim upon <hi>Province.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. So then from the beginning of the first Race, two Royall Families have possest the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The first began by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> younger brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and Son to <hi>King Robert.</hi> To him his brother <hi>Henry</hi> gave that Dutchy, in the year 1032. That Family continued from Male to Male, without any interruption of Female successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill the death of the last Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> dead without issue, <hi>An.</hi> 1362. Then King <hi>John</hi> at that time reigning in <hi>France,</hi> seizd upon that piece as an <hi>apanage;</hi> so the <hi>French</hi> call the Portions of the Sons of <hi>France,</hi> which are to return to the Crown, when Heirs Male fail. That <hi>apanage</hi> then being returned to the Crown, King <hi>John</hi> bestowed it in the same nature upon his fourth Son <hi>Philip.</hi> This was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205314:38"/>the head of the second house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which had four Dukes only successively. This <hi>Philip</hi> called <hi>le Hardy,</hi> invested by his Father, then <hi>Iohn,</hi> the third <hi>Philip le Bon,</hi> the last <hi>Charles</hi> killed before <hi>Nancy, An.</hi> 1477. who left his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> his universall Heir. She was married to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> since Emperour, and so carried all her estate into the house of <hi>Austria.</hi> From that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age came <hi>Philip Archduke,</hi> married with <hi>Jane,</hi> Inheritrix of all <hi>Spain;</hi> and by her had two Sons, <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, founders of the two Families of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> that now reign.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After the death of <hi>Charles,</hi> killed before <hi>Nancy, Lewis the</hi> XI, seized upon the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> as an <hi>apanage</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown. Although <hi>Mary</hi> and her Husband <hi>Maximilian</hi> alleaged, that the Dutchy had been given to <hi>Philip the Hardy,</hi> by his Father, <hi>King John,</hi> as an absolute gift, without any restriction of masculine descent. That question, though agitated on both sides, will alwaies remain undecided. The <hi>French</hi> Kings maintaining themselves in that possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Charles the</hi> V. Grandchild to that <hi>Mary,</hi> grounding himself upon that right, which we will declare afterwards; required by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Dutchy of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> should be restored to him as his by his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:205314:38"/>Grandmothers right, and taken from her by <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. But after the return of <hi>Francis the</hi> I, that Treaty was declared void, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to all right of Nations, which disannull Treaties made in Prison, and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by violence, &amp; contrary to the Munici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>all Laws of the State of <hi>France,</hi> which constitute the Kings to be alwaies <hi>Minors:</hi> that is, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of absolute disposition, as for the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Dominions. So the Article of that Treatise, concerning the restitution of <hi>Burgundy</hi> remained null, though signed by the King. Besides, the States Generall of the Kingdom protested to the King, that it was never in his power to alienate any Province of his State without their consent. Which last opposition was of such force, that since neither in the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Crespy in Valois</hi> (in which severall pieces were yielded unto the house of <hi>Austria</hi>) any mention was made of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Yet the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> take still the Title of <hi>Dukes of Burgundy.</hi> So much for the Fact. We will now examine the right.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It must be acknowledged that the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Apanages</hi> for the Males onely, to the exclusion of Females, is not in use among the <hi>French</hi> but since the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> who began to reign <hi>An.</hi> 1328; for remount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher to <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> we find not that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205314:39"/>exclusion of Females from successions, saving the ordinary preference of the Males before them. And the Females were admitted Heirs, in all kinds of estates, whether given by the King, or by others. Yea, many times the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Sons of <hi>France</hi> have ended in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, that have transported their Estates to other Families; as it appears in that of <hi>Dreux</hi> of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> of <hi>Courtenay,</hi> and of others. But since the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> no Son of <hi>France</hi> had any <hi>apanage</hi> but upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Which is evident, in that all the <hi>apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages</hi> are returned to the Crown by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Males, to the exclusion of Females, as those of <hi>Anjou, Berry, Alanson,</hi> and others. Yea, although that first house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> be much antienter, and hath begun almost with the third race; yet as it was the first, and most important <hi>apanage,</hi> we have in the History thereof an example of the excsusion of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males and setling the inheritance in the Males. <hi>Hugh the</hi> IV. of that name, Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Eudes</hi> his eldest, <hi>John</hi> Lord of <hi>Charrolois,</hi> and <hi>Robert the</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Burgundy. Eudes</hi> was married in his Fathers life time, died before him, and left three Daughters, <hi>Joland, Margaret,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> or <hi>Alix; John</hi> the second Son was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and died likewise before his Father, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Daughter <hi>Beatrix of Burgundy, Lady
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205314:39"/>of Bourbon.</hi> This was the Lady who being married with <hi>Robert,</hi> Son to <hi>Saint Lewis,</hi> gave a beginning to the house of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> When <hi>Eudes the</hi> IV. died, it seemed that the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the First or Second of his Sons should have inherited by the right of representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Father; but they were excluded from it by their Uncle <hi>Robert,</hi> who enjoyed it, and his Heirs Male peaceably, though these four Daughters had been married in great and potent houses.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Philip</hi> the last Duke of that Race being dead, <hi>King John</hi> took the Dutchy in his Poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ains not in expresse termes the exception of Female Heirs; but conferrs it upon him <hi>with the same rights by which himself came by it, and by which he possesseth it.</hi> Termes which have caused difficulty, because <hi>John</hi> could be said to succeed to it by two rights; the one as King, the other as the next Heir-male of the last Duke. If he succeeded to it as King, the Dutchy being an <hi>apanage,</hi> returning to the Crown in defect of Heir-Male, then without doubt it was setled upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205314:40"/>his Son <hi>Philip</hi> as a masculine <hi>apanage,</hi> both because his Father gave it him with the same right by wh<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> himself had got it. And because the severe Law of <hi>Apanages</hi> was already in use from <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> Father to <hi>John,</hi> and never was interrupted since.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But King <hi>John</hi> (say the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited of the last Duke as the next of blood, and his Heir, <hi>ab intestato,</hi> because it appeareth in the Genealogy of that first Race of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> that <hi>Robert</hi> the II, he that had excluded his four Neeces, was Father to <hi>Hugh</hi> the V. who dyed without issue, and of <hi>Eudes</hi> the IV. both successively Dukes of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> This last was Grandfather to <hi>Philip</hi> the last Duke, who ended the masuline line. But that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the II. had three Daughters besides <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> wife to King <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> whence came the house of <hi>Navarra, Jane</hi> wife to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip de Valois,</hi> and mother to King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> wife to <hi>Edward</hi> Count of <hi>Bar.</hi> They say then, that after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the last Duke, King <hi>John</hi> took that Dutchy by the right of his mother <hi>Jane,</hi> which right he transported to his Son <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of masculine apanage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they will have it evident, that femals may inherit it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Against that pretended right which was very much disputed in the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:205314:40"/>the <hi>French</hi> have strong exceptions.</p>
                     <p>The first is, That from the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> within which that gift was made, no Son of <hi>France</hi> had any great <hi>Apanage</hi> but with that restriction, against which whatsoever King <hi>John</hi> may have said or done (and he was a very imprudent and rash man) he could do no valuable deed to the detriment of the State, or against the fundamental Lawes.</p>
                     <p>The second Reason is, That since we see by the example of <hi>Hugh</hi> the IV. that females are excluded from that succession, we must acknowledge that <hi>John</hi> did not succeed by right of his mother, but as King, receiving an apanage devolved unto him.</p>
                     <p>The third Reason is, That King <hi>John</hi> was not the next Heir in blood, for by proximity of blood, the children of the <hi>eldest</hi> Daughter, which was <hi>Margaret</hi> wife to King <hi>Lewis Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> should have succeeded, not King <hi>John,</hi> who was Son to the <hi>second.</hi> Now that succession fell when that wicked man <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> Grandchild to that <hi>Margares</hi> was in his strength, who if there had beene any life in that title, would not have failed to have set it up; for <hi>Burgundy</hi> was better then all his <hi>Navarra,</hi> and the rest of his estate. And yet that stirring man did not stirre that point, or it was so slightly, that he left off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; but hotly pursued a recompence for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:205314:41"/>the Counties of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Brie,</hi> which by right belonged to his mother <hi>Jane,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Jane</hi> Countess of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Brie,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarra,</hi> wife to <hi>Philip le Bel.</hi> By all this it is evident, that the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was setled upon <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le Hardy</hi> his Son, in the nature of a true masculine <hi>apanage.</hi>

                     <p>By the partage so famous among the Sons of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> an. 843. it is certaine that all that was beyond the River <hi>Mosa</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> was cut off from that which retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name of Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> and that these three Towns remained Imperiall. But <hi>Mosa</hi> being the bound of these two States, the Empire and the Kingdome; yet by an infinity of Warres, Usurpations, and Treaties, that bound and other limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two States were often changed. In the time of the weakness and declination of the House of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> most part of the Cities and Lordships of the Empire, did can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton themselves, and made themselves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dominions under the protection of the Empire, and some remained free, others were subjected to especial Lords, some Lay,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:205314:41"/>some Ecclesiastical. All these make up now the great body of the Empire: Of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were these three Towns, <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> upon which the <hi>French</hi> Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no right till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the II.</p>
                     <p>

In the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition the Constable seized on the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. besieged towards the end of the yeare 1551. but in vain, since which time the <hi>French</hi> have enjoyed these three Cities; yet finding their right somewhat weak, they used it at the first with great moderation, calling themselves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205314:42"/>only Guardians and Protectors of the same, till <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. caused them to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incorporated with <hi>France,</hi> and in them hath establisht a soveraign Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Indeed these three Townes have of long continuance been Imperial, and being got by subtilty, upon pretence of the surety of the passage, the right of the <hi>French</hi> Kings in them should be much more disputable then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, as themselves have confest in many of their instructions for the generall Treaties. Yet it may be said for the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> the II. took them as his enemies estate, when he made War against the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi> That the Emperour never made since any stipulation for the restitution of them in any Treaty. That the rights of the Empire on this side of <hi>Rhine,</hi> are so vanisht and lost, that the Countries seem now to be <hi>primum occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panti.</hi> That <hi>Holland,</hi> also <hi>Lorraine, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Savoy, Franch County, Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Also that the French Kings at the first, declared themselves onely Protectors and Guardians of these Towns: which if afterwards they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated to their State, it was by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:205314:42"/>of the people, seeing themselves deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and neglected by the Empire. Finally, in that point the <hi>French</hi> think they may use the right of Represals. And that if the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the House of <hi>Austria</hi> should do them right about all their pretences, there would be some reason why the Emperour should be contented about these Towns.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:205314:43"/>end seeing himself ill used by the English, he grew weary of their alliance, and ashamed of the harm which he had done to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Being then contented to agree with the King, he met with him at <hi>Arras, An.</hi> 1435. This was called the Treatie of <hi>Arras,</hi> a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall piece of the History of that age, and the following. By that Treaty, after that King <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. in as little dishonorable termes as might be, had asked pardon for the killing of <hi>Duke John,</hi> when he was <hi>Dolphin,</hi> they agreed about many other Articles, and the <hi>King</hi> gave many pieces belonging to the Crown.

                     <p n="1">1.

Upon that Treaty all these Towns were delivered to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and all the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. nothing was altered in this agreement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. came to the Crown. <hi>An.</hi> 1461. who being unthankfull and malicious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had great obligations to the house of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> yet as soon as he came to the Crown, he conceived a great aversion against <hi>Charles Count of Charolois,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Philip le Bon,</hi> and would recover all those pawned Lordships, arguing the Treaty of <hi>Arras,</hi> of nullity and invalidity, maintaining that his Father could not alienate so many pieces belonging to the State, against the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Laws. To disingage these Lands, he laid great impositions upon the people, till he had raised the four hundred thousand Crownes, which he caused to be brought to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> and delivered unto the Duke, who soon after delivered all those places unto him. <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Charolois</hi> took that so heavily, that he almost died for sorrow, and conceived a mortall hatred against the Lord

And it was one of the causes of the War of the <hi>publique good;</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been carried with various successe, till the Treaty of <hi>Conflans,</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> 1465, the fourth Article whereof was, that the King should give again to the Count of <hi>Charolois,</hi> all the Townes seated upon the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> lately redeemed with 400000. Crowns, to enjoy them all his life time, and besides that, should give him the County of <hi>Guines</hi> for himself and his Heirs for ever. This <hi>Charles,</hi> who was since Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> enjoyed these Lands, though not without Wars and Divisions, against <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>Charles</hi> being dead before <hi>Nancy, An.</hi> 1477. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. did suddenly invade the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> as a masculin <hi>apanage,</hi> returning to the Crown, and all the Townes upon the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> which the French have kept ever since. Neither can the house of <hi>Austria</hi> pretend any just right to them as Heir of the house of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> both because <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. had not power to alienate these parts of his State (as his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI alledged) and because all these Townes had been alienated upon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption with a certain sum, which was paid by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. unto the Duke <hi>Philip.</hi> And if they were restored to the Count of

                        <hi>Charolois,</hi> it was for his life onely; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lewis</hi> did not seize upon them, but after the death of <hi>Charles.</hi> At which time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he took <hi>Arras,</hi> of which we will speak hereafter.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Dutchy of</hi> Britain.</head>
                     <p>The right of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> to the Dutchy of <hi>Britain,</hi> hath more ground then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former, and gave matter to many disputes, especially in the time of the <hi>League;</hi> the King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the II. representing the rights of his Daughter <hi>Isabella,</hi> both to the Kingdom, and especially to that Dutchy. And when the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> who had cantonned himselfe in it (finding himself too weak to maintain his own pretence to it, which was upon another ground) threatned to give entrance to the Spaniards into the Dutchy, <hi>La Guesle</hi> the Kings Atturney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, made a long speech to defend the Kings right, of which the summary is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Francis</hi> the II. the last Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> dying <hi>An.</hi> 1488. left two daughters, <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Isabella.</hi> The second died young. The eldest, <hi>Anne,</hi> had the whole succession, and was married first to <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. of <hi>France,</hi> by whom though she had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205314:45"/>none outlived the Father: Who being dead, she was married with his successour <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. by whom she had two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Claude</hi> married to <hi>Francis the</hi> I. who by her had <hi>Henry</hi> the II, who was Father to three Kings, <hi>Francis the</hi> II. <hi>Charles the</hi> IX, <hi>Henry the</hi> III. and to <hi>Francis Duke of Alanson,</hi> all which left no issue. He was Father also of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Third, Wife of <hi>Philip the</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who by her had the <hi>Intanta Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> Wife to <hi>Archiduke Albert,</hi> and Princess of the Low-Countries, died <hi>An.</hi> 1633, and <hi>Catherine, Dutchesse of Savoy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the III, all the masculine Race of <hi>Valois</hi> was extinct, and the next Heir of that house was <hi>Infanta Isabella,</hi> daughter to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldest Sister of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> III. So if there was any Estate in that house inheritable by women, it belonged to <hi>Isabella</hi> without question. <hi>Philip</hi> the II, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his daughter after he was once satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that his pretence to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in her behalfe was ridiculous, asked that at least the Dutchy of <hi>Britain</hi> should be restored to her, as the Estate w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> her great Grandmother <hi>Anne of Britain</hi> had brought to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, an Estate which often had past to Females, saying (as it was true) that she was the next in blood.</p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:205314:45"/>
                     <p>To these allegations these answers are given.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Dutchy of <hi>Britain</hi> had been inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapably united w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> the Crown, by the coming of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. to the Crown; for it is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rule among the French, that a King coming to the Crown, uniteth unto the same all his Estate, both Paternall and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Besides that tacit and municipall right, to which all contrary pretence must yield; there was an expresse union made <hi>An.</hi> 1532. at the request of the States Generall of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> by <hi>Francis</hi> the I. upon condition, that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> should take the Title of <hi>Dolphin of Viennois, Duke of Britain;</hi> which was then practised in the person of the <hi>Dolphin Francis,</hi> but was since neglected. That authenticall union of <hi>Britain</hi> with the Crown, cannot be disputed, since the consent of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince did intervene, and that in all publique businesses, all private rights, must bow and yield to the publique good, <hi>Salus populi supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma lex esto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Besides, ever since <hi>John of Montford</hi> by the battell of <hi>Auray An.</hi> 1364. remained Master of the Dutchy, and excluded <hi>Jane</hi> his Cosen-German, Wife to <hi>Charles de Blois,</hi> objecting that she was a woman, and that women vvere not capable Heirs of Estates of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205314:46"/>that nature; Since that time, I say it may be affirmed that Females were excluded from the succession of <hi>Britain.</hi> And that if <hi>Anne,</hi> Wife to the two Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. was admitted to it, it was by toleration; For by right, after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the last Duke, the Dutchy was devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Crown. And truly, <hi>Francis</hi> the last Duke, by his great revolts, had given sufficient cause to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> his Soveraigns to deprive him of his Estate.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The French also may here set up the right of <hi>Aubeine,</hi> which excludeth strangers, &amp; admitted none but <hi>regnicolae,</hi> inhabitants of the Kingdom to successions. Which must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially be observed in great Estates and most of all in those that owe a <hi>liedge homage.</hi> For whereas the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> did owe personal service to the King; how can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man born in <hi>Spain,</hi> tyed with blood and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse unto a house alwaies jealous, and often declared Enemy of the State of <hi>France,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that part of her duty to the Crown? a duty absolutely necessary for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body of the State unto which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of all <hi>Fees</hi> must have regard.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The French may deale besides with the house of <hi>Austria</hi> by right of <hi>represals.</hi> For since that house withholds so many Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205314:46"/>and Counties from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> without any recompence or satisfaction; they think not themselves bound to give ear to their pretences upon so little ground.</p>

                  <p>A Book was publisht <hi>An.</hi> 1634. intituled <hi>Inquisition of the rights of the King and Crown of</hi> France, <hi>upon the Kingdoms, Dutchies, Countries, Towns, and Countries usurped by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes upon the most Christian Kings,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Cassan</hi> the Kings Advocate in the <hi>Presidial of Beziers;</hi> wherein all that we have to say of this matter, is fully and curiously set down: Which though we will but sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily relate; yet we hope to adde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it both for order and matter. Wee will stand here only upon those rights which are disputed against the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Empire; both because it is our present businesse, and because all other claims are stale and of small importance.</p>
                  <p>All the pretences of the French upon the possessions of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> are either
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205314:47"/>antient and almost worn out, as the pretences upon <hi>Castilia, Portugal, Arragon, Catalonia;</hi> or later and important, upon Dominions to which they maintaine their rights, and claim them from time to time, to hinder a prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; joyning to their claim active prosecution by armes.</p>
                  <p>Though I might omit those first pretences as too stale, yet I will here set them down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, for the information of curious Readers.</p>
                  <p>All the pretences either new or old of the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> are either within or without <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that <hi>Peninsula,</hi> called <hi>Spain,</hi> inclosed within the great Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> since the invasion of the <hi>Saracens, an.</hi> 713. there hath been a great number of petty States under the Title of Kingdomes, Dutchies, Counties, &amp;c. into which that great Province was divided, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Moores</hi> when they conquered the Land, or by the <hi>Christians</hi> when they recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered it; and it is but a hundred and fifty yeares, since there was yet five remarkable distinct soveraignties in <hi>Spain, Castilia, Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Navarra, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> four of which <hi>Castilia, Arragon, Navarra,</hi> and <hi>Granada</hi> were united by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholique. <hi>Portugal</hi> came to the House of <hi>Austria, an.</hi>

We consider onely that there be six pieces within <hi>Spain,</hi> upon which the <hi>French</hi> have pretences, <hi>Castilia, Portugal, Navarra, Arragon, Catalonia,</hi> and the County of <hi>Rous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillon.</hi> And out of <hi>Spain</hi> they claim a right to the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois.</hi>

                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:205314:48"/>was married to <hi>Lewis</hi> the VIII. King of <hi>Frances</hi> and was mother of St <hi>Lewis. Berengera</hi> was married to <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the IX. King of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the death of <hi>Henry, Blanch</hi> as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, was the undoubted Heir of <hi>Castilia,</hi> and <hi>Beringera</hi> had no right to it being the yongest. Yet because <hi>Beringera</hi> was within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>Blanch</hi> lived in <hi>France</hi> very farre, she seized upon the state, and with it invested her Son <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> although many of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees opposed it, standing for the right of <hi>Blanch,</hi> which caused great troubles till St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to whom <hi>Castilia</hi> belonged after his Mother, thus composed the difference.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the usurper of <hi>Castilia</hi> over <hi>Blanch</hi> and St <hi>Lewis,</hi> was Father of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the X.

By the contract of marriage, it was agreed that S. <hi>Lewis</hi> yielded all his rights over <hi>Castilia,</hi> to his Daughter <hi>Blanch,</hi> and her Children after her; upon which conditions performed, <hi>France</hi> lost her claime upon that Kingdome; but that <hi>Ferdinand de la Cerda</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his Father <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> and his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205314:49"/>Brother <hi>Sanchez</hi> usurped the Crown, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving his Nephews, Sons to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> of their right. From that usurper <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez,</hi> all the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to this day are descended. From the dispossest Children of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> is descended the House of the Dukes of <hi>Medina Coeli,</hi> who retaining still the memory of that degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of their birth-right over the family of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> make their protestations at every change of State, that if the family now reigning should fail, they might enter upon their right.</p>
                     <p>Out of that discourse, four things doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult for our purpose.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Castilia,</hi> all the right of the Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his sister <hi>Blanch,</hi> and after her, to her Son St <hi>Lewis;</hi> and that <hi>Berengera</hi> the younger sister of <hi>Blanch,</hi> and her Son <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> were usurpers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That St <hi>Lewis</hi> indeed yeelded his rights by the contract of marriage between <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de la Cerda,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Blanch.</hi> One might say, that it was more then he could doe; for the rights of the Crown can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alienated. But they had not then such absolute maxims, and were not so jealous as now of preserving the union of States, which in those dayes were often divided, exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205314:49"/>bought and sold. And St <hi>Lewis</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perceived the impossibility of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Castilians</hi> together.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But that Cession was conditionall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that the Children of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> should inherit the Crown. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition having been violated by the usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> younger Brother to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the poor Princes, Children to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> being disinherited and proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that cession of St <hi>Lewis</hi> becomes void by right, and the claim of the <hi>French</hi> might be good, if it was not somewhat too old.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. At least all that Right of St <hi>Lewis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines with the descendants of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Medina Coeli,</hi> for they have double right, the one from <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> as elder Brother to <hi>Sanchez;</hi> the other from <hi>Blanch,</hi> to whom her Father St <hi>Lewis</hi> had conferred his right. And if the House of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Coeli</hi> would prosecute it, they should be well grounded, and the <hi>French</hi> Kings might defend their claim very justly, as their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors and fetching their right from them.</p>

The most eminent was <hi>Henry,</hi> of the first Royal House of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> for although there hath been much dispute about his Origine, now all Historians acknowledge that he was Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to <hi>Robert,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the I, who had <hi>Burgundy</hi> given him for his <hi>apanage.</hi> This <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> having done great exploits against the <hi>Moores,</hi> married <hi>Teresa,</hi> naturall Daughter of <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> who gave her for her portion the Townes of <hi>Coimbra,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:205314:50"/>Braga,</hi> and others in <hi>Portugal,</hi> with forces to conquer the rest, of which he quitted himself so well, that he expelled the Infidels from great part of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of which he was called <hi>Comes</hi> or <hi>Count,</hi> and no other title did he bear all his life time. He dyed <hi>an.</hi> 1112. and left a Son named <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> who took <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and much Country besides, and was called the first King of <hi>Portugal, an.</hi> 1139. From that <hi>Alphonsus</hi> is descended the whole House of <hi>Portugal,</hi> till the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>King, an.</hi> 1580. at which time <hi>Portugal</hi> was united with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great difficulty about the succession of that Kingdom, whether it belong to the house of <hi>Spain,</hi> or to that of <hi>Braganza,</hi> or to that of <hi>Parma,</hi> is nothing to this purpose. It hath wearied the reasoning of the greatest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians for threescore yeares, and finally hath ended in a generall revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and a bloody War. Certainly, although such as are most jealous of the growth of <hi>Spaine,</hi> will vote for the House of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and that of <hi>Parma,</hi> the question is not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>France</hi> hath a further pretence to the Kindom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for which we must remount higher. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the II, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Sanchez</hi> the II, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Capel,</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus. Sanchez</hi> raigned
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205314:51"/>after his Father, but with small vigour, and was despised by his subjects. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> living then in the Court of St <hi>Lewis,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much honour, as being his kinsman by <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Castilia</hi> the Kings Mother. By his meanes he married <hi>Mahaut</hi> of <hi>Dampmartin,</hi> Widow to a Prince of the blood, <hi>an.</hi> 1235. and by her had Children. The people of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> weary of their King <hi>Sanchez,</hi> desired <hi>Alphonsus</hi> to come home, and take the tuition of the State, which he did, leaving his wife <hi>Mahaut</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And his Brother being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded and himselfe made King, he forgot his wife and children in <hi>France,</hi> and married <hi>Beatrix,</hi> naturall Daughter of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the IX King of <hi>Castilia,</hi> who gave her for her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Kingdom of <hi>Algarba.</hi> Because his first wife was living, that 2<seg rend="sup">d</seg> marriage was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unlawful; yea, <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for it by <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the IV. and hated by all the Princes; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut</hi> coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> made a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against him. Who was so hardened in that sin, that he protested that if a hundred wives would have him, he would marry them all. Yet being a great Warriour, and a wise and prosperous King, he maintained himself by the love of his subjects, insomuch that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut</hi> being dead, the Bishops of <hi>Portugal</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his absolution of <hi>Urban</hi> the IV. and the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:205314:51"/>confirmation of that second marriage of which he had Children. One of them, and his successour, was <hi>Denis, Alphonsus</hi> being dead, <hi>an.</hi> 1279. From that <hi>Denis</hi> are descended all the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> to this day.</p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>French</hi> Historians affirme, that <hi>Mahaut</hi> had two Sons by <hi>Alphonsus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the one that dyed young, the other <hi>Robert,</hi> from whom the whole House of the Counts of <hi>Bullen</hi> is descended, which fell to <hi>Magdalen de la Cour,</hi> wife to <hi>Laurens</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> by whom came <hi>Katherine de Medicis,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the three late <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Francis</hi> the II. <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, and <hi>Henry</hi> the III, after whose death (by the substitution set downe before in the contract betweene her and <hi>Henry</hi> the II,) the inheritance of <hi>Katherine</hi> came to her Daughter Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> first Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. That Queen made the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> her Heir, who since was <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII.</p>
                     <p>When the dispute for the succession of <hi>Portugal</hi> was open, after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Cardinal King</hi> an. 1570, <hi>Katherine</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> among other pretenders to that Crown, set forth her claim by <hi>Belloy,</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Generall in the Parliament of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> who pleaded that from the marriage of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> and <hi>Mahaut,</hi> a Son was born called <hi>Robert,</hi> and had succeeded in all his rights,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205314:52"/>that <hi>Beatrix</hi> was the Concubine, not the wife of <hi>Alphonsus;</hi> and that the Pope could not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate <hi>Denis</hi> born of adultery, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Robert</hi> the true Heir of <hi>Alphonsus.</hi> Also that all the Kings that had reigned since <hi>Denis</hi> for three hundred years, made no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, because there can be no prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the right of Kingdoms. That right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded to the Estates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was found too old and stale, and injurious to all their Kings; neither did they make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. Besides, the Spanish Historians affirm, that <hi>Alphonsus</hi> had no issue by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut,</hi> and that among the protestations which <hi>Mahaut</hi> made in <hi>Portugal</hi> against <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> there is not one word of the injury which he did to her children, which she would not have forgot if she had had any: Yet that right may be defended by the testimony of the French Historians, and by this true allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that neither a bastard nor his Descent can prescribe against the lawfull Heirs.</p>

The two other children of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Navarra</hi> were two daughters. The eldest <hi>Blanch of Arragon,</hi> who having been married with <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. <hi>King of Castilia,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Impotent,</hi> was separated from him, by reason of his impotency, and died without issue.

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>John of Albret, and Catherine de Foix,</hi> had a Son called <hi>Henry,</hi> who was <hi>King of Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and married <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sister to <hi>Francis the first of France,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Jane,</hi> Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritrix of <hi>Navarra; Jane</hi> being married to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony of Bourbon,</hi> was by him Mother of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France,</hi> Father to <hi>Lewis the</hi> XIII, and Grandfather to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205314:54"/>of <hi>Navarra.</hi> Hence it is manifest, how the last Kings of <hi>Navarra</hi> by the interesse of their Alliance, and Estate were obliged to follow the party of <hi>France.</hi> Now it hapned, <hi>An.</hi> 1510. after that <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. had hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Venetians</hi> by the victory of <hi>Aignadel,</hi> and brought terrour among all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the II. fell out with <hi>Lewis,</hi> and prosecuted the quarrell with such animosity, (<hi>Lewis</hi> on the other side, being as fierce as he) that the contention grew almost into a Schism: <hi>Julius</hi> excommunicated all that took part with <hi>Lewis,</hi> and put an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> (as they call it) upon their Estates. <hi>Lewis</hi> maintained himself against his fulminations, both by an Assembly of his Prelates at <hi>Tours,</hi> who <hi>cleared the obligations of the Kings consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as his History speaks, and especially by armes, whereby he represt all the invaders of his State, and put them to the defence of their own. But <hi>John d' Albret, and Catherine of Navarra,</hi> were expelled from their State by <hi>Ferdinand the Catholique,</hi> who making a shew to passe into <hi>Guienne</hi> to join with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and seize upon the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> by vertue of the Papall interdict, suddenly turned upon <hi>Navarra,</hi> and took it, <hi>An.</hi> 1512. both because <hi>John d' Albret</hi> was united with the French King, who was a rebell against the Church, and an Enemy to the <hi>English,</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:205314:54"/>with whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had alliance; also because the Spaniards hold that there was a tacit agreement between the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to suffer that any of the Spanish Crowns should fall into forrain hands, or into houses not soveraign, as those of <hi>Foix and Albret.</hi> As the reason and pretence of that invasion, was leight and groundlesse, the French stand to their right to this day, against that manifest, invasion, and hinder the prescription by arms Treaties and Protestations.</p>

                     <p>The like may be said of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which is a great Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> bounded on the East and South with the Mediterranean Sea, and on the other sides with <hi>Valentia, Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and <hi>Roussillon.</hi> It was both before the Romans and under them, part of <hi>Hispania Tarraconensis,</hi> as <hi>Arragon</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries near the River of <hi>Ebro.</hi> Since which time being conquered by the <hi>Gotths</hi> and <hi>Alans</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was called by them <hi>Gottalania,</hi> which name was since corrupted to <hi>Catalau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> It was under the Kings of the <hi>Gotths,</hi> till the invasion of the <hi>Saracens, an.</hi> 713. who made themselves Masters of it, as of most part of <hi>Spain;</hi> But <hi>Charlemagne</hi> took it from them, and all the Country near the River of <hi>Ebro,</hi> about the year 800. expelling <hi>Zaron</hi> the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205314:57"/>
                        <hi>Moore</hi> out of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and put a French Garrison in it; not long after he gave it to <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was the first Count of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and was a powerfull and considerable man in the Court of <hi>Lewis the Meek;</hi> and the <hi>Counts</hi> of that Province, who then were but Goverours, were a long time ordinary Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Attendants of the French Kings. But by the idlenesse of the last descent of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the Governours of Provinces; and of this among the rest, made themselves Masters.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the third Race of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, the Family that ruled in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> was that of the <hi>Beringers.</hi> And that County was alwayes separate from the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> till the yeare 1131, when <hi>Don Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Bellador,</hi> because he fought twenty two battels, being dead without issue, the people of <hi>Arragon</hi> tooke <hi>Ramires</hi> out of the <hi>Cloister</hi> of St. <hi>Pontius</hi> of <hi>Tomieres,</hi> where he had lived forty yeares a Monk, because he was of the Royal blood, and Son to <hi>Sanchez Ramires,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> He was married by a dispensation of <hi>Anaclet</hi> the II, Pope, or rather Anti-pope, and had a Daughter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Petronilla,</hi> married to <hi>Raymond Berenger,</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> So <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia</hi> were united, and never separated since. <hi>James</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:205314:57"/>King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> an. 1320. by the advice of the State of the Land, made the Law of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three Provinces, <hi>Arragon, Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> not to be possest separately any more. Together with that Law, <hi>Catalonia</hi> agreed with the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that she should have her forces and priviledges <hi>apart;</hi> and that the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who took on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the title of Counts of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> should oblige themselves by oath to observe that condition. This precaution of the <hi>Catalans</hi> hath justified their late revolt, which the most conscionable among them have yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, acknowledging that their King had viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is a constant truth, that all that time, from the conquest of <hi>Charlemagne, Catalonia,</hi> was a <hi>Fee</hi> depending from France; <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> made the first Counts of it, who were his Courtiers. The first upon whom it was settled, as a French <hi>Fee,</hi> was <hi>Geffery le Velu,</hi> invested by <hi>Charles le Gros, an.</hi> 885. And <hi>Bera</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> being accused of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony before <hi>Lewis le Begue</hi> offered to purge himselfe by a Duell after the manner of the time, in which being overcome, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Fee, and another invested with it.</p>
                     <p>All that time also, all the publique Acts of Notaries in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> were done in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205314:58"/>name of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted mark of Supremacy, and all the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Counts of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> did homage for it to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> till the yeare 1181. and in the beginning of <hi>Philip</hi> the Conquerour, when <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> called a Councill at <hi>Tarracona,</hi> a Town of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where under colour of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and respect to Religion, he caused an Order to be made, that from thenceforth the yeares of the French Kings should no more be put in the Deeds and Contracts of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> but the yeares of Christ. And the same King having neglected that homage to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that right was lost under <hi>Philip Auguste, Lewis</hi> the VIII. and St <hi>Lewis,</hi> the claim onely remaining. In which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, likely the Princes of <hi>Arragon</hi> were educated in the Court of <hi>France;</hi> one of them was <hi>James,</hi> who lived in the time of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and had been educated with <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> who being come to visit that King, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given him his sister <hi>Isabella</hi> to wife; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> say, that by reason of that match, and the cession which <hi>James</hi> made to <hi>Philip</hi> of the Town of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> and of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands which he possest in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> the said King <hi>Philip</hi> quitted all his right of supremacy over <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> That Treaty was <hi>an.</hi> 1270, by which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205314:58"/>conceive that they have shaken the yoak of French Soveraignty. But whether that Treaty be valid or no, either for the fact or the right, that cession being above 380 years old, it seems authenticall, and the French have given over that claim.</p>
                     <p>But they have another of latter date. For by reason of the massacre made in the <hi>Siclian Vespers,</hi> an. 1281. <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> was excommunicated, &amp; his Lands put in interdict, and given to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le Hardy,</hi> by <hi>Martin</hi> the IV, Pope, or to his Son Count of <hi>Valois;</hi> but that right being the same, as the right which the French claime, or did claim upon <hi>Arragon,</hi> of which we spake lately, we will not here repeat.</p>
                     <p>So the French rights over <hi>Catalonia,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to these two heads. The first is taken from the conquest of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishing of Counts and Governours in the same, the homage done to the Kings of France, the years of their reign ascribed in their deeds both private and publique. The other is the same, as is pretended upon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon.</hi> Of both, the French make no great account. Onely because of late years, <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> hath shaken the yoke of the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Castilia,</hi> and have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the French; it may be disputed, whether the French King may use any of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205314:59"/>these old stale Titles, or whether he must ground the justice of his possession upon the donation which the <hi>Catalans</hi> have made to him, holding themselves free from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Spaniard, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of their priviledges. Certainly in all particular Treaties, the unobservation of the conditions, freeth the parties from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the contract. But as for Soveraignties, and the mutual obligations of Kings and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many will reason otherwise; saying, that although the obligation be mutual as for the conscience; yet as for the retrocession and the penalty attending the breach of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it doth not reach to Kings, whose actions are not censurable by the people; not by the nature of the contract which is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and reciprocall, but for the danger of the consequence which might authorize revolts. Others also will say, that a Country giving her selfe to a Prince, what priviledges soever the people reserve to themselves by contract, they are all lost when they enter into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which by its nature makes a man sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another man without any exception, when the publique good is concerned; &amp; that those priviledges by that subjection, passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of meer liberties and concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes, which they may stretch, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish, and over-throw, according to their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205314:59"/>discretion. Certainly in all these contentions between the people, and the Soveraign pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and interests bear a great sway, &amp; make conscience plead on both sides. But any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will passe when there is strength to back it.</p>

                     <p>That little Country at the foot of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees,</hi> and near the <hi>golph of Leon,</hi> was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently part of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and for a long time past through the same fortunes and changes. It was for a great while part of the County of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and Dutchy of <hi>Narbon.</hi> Then it came into the hands of particular Counts, which failing, the Country fell to the Counts of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> How, and in what time precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I find not. Onely I find that in the time of St <hi>Lewis, Alphonsus</hi> his Brother, Count of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> and the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> being in suit about the County of <hi>Roussillon,</hi> St <hi>Lewis</hi> was chosen Umpire, as bearing himselfe for Soveraign of both, who therefore ought to be their Judge, and he did adjudge it to the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> against his own Brother. It seems that holy King acknowledged the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of their possession. For as that County
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205314:60"/>was united with that of <hi>Barcelonia,</hi> it was held also by the same right.</p>
                     <p>Since the union of these with the Crown of <hi>Arragon,</hi> it ran the same fortune with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> and was conquered by <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> by vertue of the Interdict of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the IV. <hi>Philip</hi> died at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and soon after, all was lost, and quited by <hi>Charles de Valois</hi> his second Son. But of that right, &amp; all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the house of <hi>Anjou</hi> upon <hi>Roussillon,</hi> as upon <hi>Arragon and Catalonia,</hi> the French themselves make no great account.</p>
                     <p>But upon <hi>Roussillon,</hi> the French have a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle altogether singular. <hi>John King of Arragon,</hi> that lived in the time of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. <hi>of France,</hi> being in War with his subjects of <hi>Arragon and Catalonia,</hi> as maintainers of his Son, <hi>Charles Prince of Vienna,</hi> and the true Heir of <hi>Navarra</hi> against him, and finding his Subjects too hard for him, as assisted by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> King of <hi>Castilia;</hi> desired <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. to assist him, which he did with great might, having sent him a good Army under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Charles d' Armagnac,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> who confirmed the Crown to <hi>John,</hi> and composed the difference between him and his Subjects. At which time, <hi>John</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the County of <hi>Roussillon,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Perpignan</hi> unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. for three hundred thousand Crownes which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205314:60"/>of him. <hi>Lewis,</hi> notwithstanding many treacheries and attempts of the <hi>Arrogenese,</hi> maintained himself in that Country, and <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. his Son after him, untill the design of the Conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was in the year 1492. that <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. began the enterprise of <hi>Naples.</hi> And fearing least <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Son to that <hi>John</hi> would assist the house of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was a branch of that of <hi>Arragon;</hi> or should enter into <hi>France</hi> in his absence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto him that County of <hi>Roussillon, gratis;</hi> not quitting, but not demanding the three hundred thousand Crowns; the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> having promist, and sworn upon the holy Crosse, and upon the Gospels, that hee would serve the King against all his Enemies in that expedition of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Perpignan</hi> did not yield, but after many iterated commands, seeing the importance of that restitution, and fearing the infidelity of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The French Historians blame <hi>James Maillert,</hi> a Franciscan Frier, Confessour to <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. saying, he was won by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> to perswade the King to that restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> instead of helping <hi>Charles</hi> in his expedition of <hi>Italy,</hi> helped his Enemies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and disturbed his enterprise of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Since which time, the French have often redemanded that County, as not redeemed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205314:61"/>with the three hundred thousand Crownes, and represented that they were circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but in vain, till finally the sword hath done what reason and justice could not. <hi>Perpignan</hi> being besieged, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. of late years.</p>
                     <p>Thus of those six rights which the French pretend within the limits of <hi>Spain.</hi> Those of <hi>Castilia, Portugal, and Arragon,</hi> are old and stale. That of <hi>Navarra</hi> is in its full force by their ordinary protestations. That of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Roussillon</hi> are no more pretended rights, the French having the real possession of them.</p>

So that part of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and all that is on this side of the two Rivers remained with the Empire of the West. The part beyond them with the Iland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> remained with the Emperour of the East.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, the Saracens invaded <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> The height of their fury, was about the year 850. and in the parts about <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> it self, where they setled themselves. And for many Ages, those Countries were the sad stage, where the Latins on the one side, and the Greekes on the other, and the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens enemies to both, acted a bloody Tragedy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About the year 1000, forty <hi>Norman</hi> Gentlemen returning from the Pilgrimage of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> gave a powerfull assistance to the Christians of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and being returned home, undertook not long after an expedition to <hi>Naples</hi> with more might, under the conduct of <hi>Tristan Cistel,</hi> a Norman.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:205314:62"/>to the State of <hi>Naples,</hi> partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, partly by marriage, under the names of the <hi>Counts</hi> of the <hi>Crosse of Puglia,</hi> and <hi>Dukes of Calabria,</hi> and in time advancing their conquests as far as <hi>Sicily,</hi> they were crowned Kings of the same. To that Family of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> succeeded that of the <hi>Germans</hi> in the persons of <hi>Henry the</hi> VI. <hi>and Friderick the</hi> II, Emperours and Kings of <hi>Naples.</hi> That <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> being fallen into the hatred of the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> which is Soveraign of that <hi>Fee,</hi> he was deprived of that <hi>State.</hi> After his death his Son <hi>Conrard,</hi> and his bastard <hi>Manfred,</hi> and <hi>Conradin</hi> Son of <hi>Conrard,</hi> having laboured to maintain himself in it; finally the house of <hi>France</hi> was called to it after this manner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1262.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the falling out of all these Princes with the Popes, great confusions happened in <hi>Italie.</hi> The Pope <hi>Innocent the</hi> IV, weary of the German race, presented the Kingdome to <hi>Saint Lewis</hi> for his brother <hi>Charles, Count of Anjou, and Provence,</hi> who was reputed a great Warriour.

                     <p>Next, it must be known that this wicked <hi>Jane,</hi> lascivious and cruel, so farre as to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her Husband <hi>Andrew,</hi> a young Prince of that other Branch of <hi>Hungary,</hi> filled her Kingdome with great troubles by her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse. Towards the end of her reigne, <hi>an.</hi> 1378. hapned the great Schisme of the Church, when <hi>Urban</hi> the VI, being made Pope by violence, many Cardinals elected in his stead, <hi>Robert</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205314:63"/>took the name of <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. Queen <hi>Jane</hi> being an enemy to <hi>Urban,</hi> who was born her subject, declared her self for <hi>Clement.</hi> Her crim whereby she had put her Husband to death, had been long covered by an accomodation made by <hi>Clement</hi> the VI, who appeased <hi>Lewis the great,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Brother to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> whom <hi>Jane</hi> had strangled. But Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the VI, to be avenged of <hi>Jane,</hi> stirred again the House of <hi>Hungary</hi> against her, and a Prince of that House, named <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> came and besieged her in <hi>Castello del Ovo</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> took her and strangled her, <hi>an.</hi> 1382. in the same place, as some say, where she had strangled her first husband.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the same Princess seeing that <hi>Urban</hi> invited the house of <hi>Hungary</hi> to the conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> called to her help King <hi>Charles</hi> the VI, of <hi>France, an.</hi> 1380. by the advice of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi> And by his leave, (for he bore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for her Soveraign) she adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the V, of <hi>France,</hi> and head of the second house of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou.</hi> He was at that time Regent of <hi>France,</hi> in the minority of King <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. From that adoption the French fetch their right in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> for from the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of that <hi>Lewis,</hi> the French Kings have inherited.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> after he had strangled
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205314:64"/>Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> seized upon the Kingdome, and reigned in her stead, and after him his two Children; first <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> whom the French Historians call <hi>Lancelot,</hi> and <hi>Jane the Second.</hi> They three held the State 53. yeares, from the yeare 1382. till the yeare 1436. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Jane the first,</hi> a little afore her death, had adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> that house of <hi>Duras</hi> had continuall War with the house of <hi>Anjou. Lewis</hi> the I. came to <hi>Naples</hi> and there dyed. <hi>Lewis</hi> the II, his Son, had great Wars with <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> and for a time was Master of the Kingdome. That <hi>Ladislaus</hi> being dead without issue, <hi>an.</hi> 1414. his sister Queen <hi>Jane the Second,</hi> succeeded him, as bad a woman as the first <hi>Jane,</hi> for impudicity and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy. She being degraded by the Pope, <hi>Martin</hi> the V: and <hi>Lewis</hi> the III, Grandchild of the first <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> named by him to reign in her place; she adopted <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for her Son, with whom that <hi>Lewis</hi> the III, had great Warres, and had sometimes the better, sometimes the worst. But <hi>Jane</hi> being of an inconstant spirit, despised <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> being altogether govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her favorite <hi>John Carraciolo,</hi> which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> not able to beare, made himselfe Master of the City of <hi>Naples.</hi> Upon which she cancelled her will made in favour of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and instead of him, adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> the IV.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:205314:64"/>of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who before was her enemy. That adoption made <hi>an.</hi> 1422. is the second ground of the claime of the French to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and the seed of so many Wars and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and of the greatest divisions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houses of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> maintaining the first adoption as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, because <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> though accused by <hi>Jane</hi> of ungratefulnesse, upon which she ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the disanulling of his adoption, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as they say) against the respect due to his adoptive Mother; but onely went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to represse the extravagancies of that light-brained woman, to have that part in her affaires which by right belonged to him, and especially curb the insolency of <hi>Carraciolo,</hi> who kept a scandalous familiarity with that woman. The French say, that the second adoption is of more validity: That the cause of ungratefulnesse is sufficient to break an adoption: That <hi>Alphonsus</hi> misused his adoptive Mother, seized upon the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> besieged her, and kept her shut up, and did all acts of Soveraign, to her contempt and disgrace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This <hi>Lewis</hi> the IV. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered <hi>Naples,</hi> enjoyed it with some peace together with <hi>Jane,</hi> but dyed before her, <hi>an.</hi> 1434. Because he left no issue, she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted his Brother <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205314:65"/>her selfe soon after dyed. But <hi>René</hi> being then kept prisoner by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he could not go to receive his inheritance. His wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> went, but too late, though at the first she got some advantage. In the end <hi>Alphonsus</hi> remained Master, and the party of <hi>Anjou</hi> was quite expelled out of the Land. Onely <hi>René</hi> kept the possession of <hi>Provence,</hi> which was an appurtenance of that State: for since the first adoption of <hi>Lewis</hi> the I, Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by Queen <hi>Jane</hi> the I. that second house of <hi>Anjou,</hi> had kept the possession of <hi>Provence.</hi> Neither did <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> nor his Children, nor <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> possess any thing in it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>René</hi> dying <hi>an.</hi> 1480. although his Daughter <hi>Yoland</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> had left children, he left the inheritance of the County of <hi>Provence,</hi> and of his Rights upon <hi>Naples, Charles Count du Maine,</hi> Son to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same name and title. And <hi>Charles</hi> dying likewise without issue, left <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI, his Heir in all his states, and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> successours to <hi>Lewis. Lewis</hi> neglecting to go to <hi>Naples</hi> held by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> bastard of that <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> and by his Children, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe to hold <hi>Provence.</hi> But his Sonne, <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. undertook the conquest of <hi>Naples, an.</hi> 1493. and after him, <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, and <hi>Francis</hi> the I. In the next Chapter
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205314:65"/>we shall see the severall Wars, Partages, and Treaties, between these two Houses for that Kingdom</p>
                     <p>So all the Rights of the House of <hi>France</hi> to the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> are reduced to these heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The investiture by <hi>Urban</hi> the IV. in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Charles</hi> brother to St <hi>Lewis.</hi> A weak Right if it were alone; the French Kings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not succeeded to that family by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for all that belongs to any branch of the House of <hi>France,</hi> doth not therefore belong to France.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Adoption of <hi>Lewis</hi> the first, of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond house of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by Queen <hi>Jane</hi> the I. by the counsell and leave of <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. who was acknowledged by <hi>France</hi> for a true Pope. By that adoption the right of <hi>Naples</hi> fel to the house of <hi>Anjou,</hi> of which the French Kings have inherited.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The two adoptions made by Queen <hi>Jane</hi> the II. first of <hi>Lewis</hi> the III. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and after him, of his Brother <hi>René.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The will of <hi>Charles Count du Maine,</hi> who named <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. his heir both of <hi>Provence,</hi> and of his right to the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and his successors, Kings of France after him.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Dutchy of</hi> Milan.</head>
                     <p>After the wrack of the Roman Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 400. all the Countries about the River of <hi>Po,</hi> towards the Alpes were taken by <hi>Theodorick Goth,</hi> and kept by his children, till about the year 550. that they were recovered by <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius</hi> and <hi>Narses,</hi> two Captaines of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Justinian.</hi> But soon after the same Countries were won by the <hi>Ostrogoths,</hi> Kings of <hi>Italy,</hi> and again by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great State there, and maintained it till the time of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who destroyed it, <hi>an.</hi> 774. After which time all the Towns of those parts were Imperial, belonging to whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Empire of the West. The house of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being degenerated and having lost the Empire, after the yeare 900. the Empire was disputed between the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the German Princes for 50 yeares. In the end the Germans having prevailed in the person of <hi>Otho</hi> the I; &amp; the Emperors his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours having chosen the seat of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Germany, and being at odds many times with the Popes, their power sensibly decayed in <hi>Italy,</hi> and great part of the Towns of <hi>Lombardy</hi> slipt out of their Dominion, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:205314:66"/>chose to themselves <hi>Italian</hi> Lords, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours retaining the shadow only of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. Many also chose liberty, &amp; a Popular State, as <hi>Siena, Pisa, Florence, Genoa,</hi> and others. In these confusions the City of <hi>Milan</hi> was usurped by the <hi>Viscounts of Angleria,</hi> a small place in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themselvs about six hundred years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that name and quality of Vicounts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the year 1497. that the Emperour <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teslaus</hi> (not <hi>Friderick,</hi> as <hi>Gassan</hi> saith) erected <hi>Milan</hi> into a Dutchy. The first Duke was <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas the</hi> III. who had married <hi>Isabella</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>John,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Galeas</hi> had three Sons, <hi>John Maria,</hi> that succeeded him and died without issue, <hi>Philip Maria</hi> that succeeded his brother, who likewise died without issue, leaving a bastard daughter named <hi>Bona,</hi> married to <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> a Souldier of Fortune, but a gallant man. <hi>That first Duke Galeas,</hi> besides these two Sons had a daughter called <hi>Valentina,</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles the</hi> V. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> an. 1398. Her Father gave her the County of <hi>Ast</hi> for her portion, with a Million of Livers wherewith the <hi>County of Blois</hi> was bought, <hi>Chasteauduro, Soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssons,</hi> and other Lordships. And by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Matrimony, it was declared, that if the masculine line of <hi>Galeas</hi> should fail, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentina</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:205314:67"/>and her children should succeed in the Dutchy. It is true that this clause had this great defect, that the Dutchy beeing establisht a masculine <hi>Fee, Galeas</hi> could not make it fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine without the Emperours leave, which was not demanded, because the Empire was then vacant by the degradation of <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> whom the Electors deposed for his idlenesse. But it is pretended that the Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. who then had his <hi>See</hi> at <hi>Avignon,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that contract; for that right the Popes challenge in the vacancy of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever <hi>John Maria,</hi> and <hi>Philip Maria,</hi> being dead without lawfull issue, none had more right to that succession then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Valentina.</hi> But that succession fel in the heat of the confusions of <hi>France,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the VII, when the two Sons of <hi>Valentina, Charls Duke of Orleans,</hi> &amp; <hi>John Count</hi> of <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme,</hi> were Prisoners in <hi>England,</hi> where the eldest remained five and twenty years, and the second well nigh thirty. In that long time it was easie for <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> who had married <hi>Bona</hi> the bastard, daughter of <hi>Duke Philip Maria,</hi> to make himself Master of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> of which he procured, and obtained the investiture from the Emperour <hi>Friderick the</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. This <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> had two Sons, whom he left to the tuition of his brother <hi>Ludovick Sforza,</hi> so samous in the History of <hi>Milan,</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:205314:67"/>who having made away his pupills, seized upon the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and was expelled out of it by <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. <hi>King of France,</hi> and since was taken &amp; carried to <hi>Loches,</hi> where he died in Prison. He left two Sons, <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who was restored by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and since taken by <hi>Francis the</hi> I. and died in <hi>France.</hi> His other Son was <hi>Francis Sforza the second,</hi> who died without issue, 1534. So that house of <hi>Sforza</hi>'s maintained the usurpation of <hi>Milan</hi> well nigh a hundred years among many wars and divisions; the lawfull right remaining still in the house of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>County of Ast,</hi> which is part of that Dutchy.</p>
                     <p>But that right could not be prosecuted, 1. In the desolation of the house of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the great divisions between that house and the house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> 2. In the long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of the two Princes of <hi>Orleans,</hi> 3. In the great troubles of the State of <hi>France</hi> almost all the reign of <hi>Charles the</hi> VII. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. had many other businesses all his time. Neither did he love the house of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Princes of his blood; And of all things he hated the Wars of <hi>Italie,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would never go, neither for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Naples,</hi> nor for the receiving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Genoa</hi> that gave her self to him. 5. All the time of <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII, was spent in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:205314:68"/>Wars, or in the Conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi> And <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII, Grandchild of <hi>Valentina,</hi> come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown, <hi>an.</hi> 1498, had no more in the Dutchy, but the County of <hi>Ast,</hi> the rest being held by <hi>Ludovick Sforza,</hi> Son to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader <hi>Francis,</hi> and himself invader of the State of his Nephews. But <hi>Lewis</hi> following his right, comes to <hi>Milan,</hi> takes it and expells <hi>Ludovic,</hi> who returning not long after, enters into <hi>Milan,</hi> but there being suddenly invested by <hi>Lewis,</hi> he is taken, carried into <hi>France,</hi> where he dieth a Prisoner, <hi>Lewis</hi> remaining Master of the Dutchy. But because <hi>Ludovic</hi> had two Sons protected in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> I. <hi>Lewis</hi> to strengthen his right, made meanes to win the Emperours favour, of whom in the end he obtained two investitures of that Dutchy. The one <hi>An.</hi> 1506 for <hi>Lewis</hi> and his children, and lawfull Heirs, and <hi>Lewis</hi> for the acknowledgement of this investiture, paid him sixty thousand livers, and promist to give him every year a pair of golden spurrs at Christmas. Also in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture, the exclusion of <hi>Sforza</hi> is precisely exprest, and a marriage concluded betweene <hi>Charles</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who since was the Emperour <hi>Charles the</hi> V. and <hi>Claude</hi> the eldest daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. which also was comprehended in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture. The other was <hi>an.</hi> 1509. wherby
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:205314:68"/>the same Emperour confirms the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture, with a condition of the marriage between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Claude,</hi> which indeed was not effected, but that hinders not the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the investiture, which was absolute, the first at least. By vertue of that right, <hi>Lewis</hi> remained possest of that Dutchy; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his reigne, <hi>maximilian Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was put in possession of that Dutchy by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> by the consent of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who was displeased that <hi>Claude,</hi> promised to <hi>Charls</hi> his Grandchild, had been married to <hi>Francis,</hi> who after was <hi>Francis the first King of France,</hi> which he took for an affront, and this was the first seed of the jealousies between the two houses of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Francis</hi> the first having regained the Dutchy, and taken <hi>Maximilian,</hi> neglected to do homage to the Emperour; and a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Charles</hi> having succeeded his Grandfather in the Empire, the animosities grew to a great height betwixt these two Princes, and they became implacable, fighting with great might about <hi>Milan,</hi> till that, by the <hi>Treaty of Madrid, Francis the first</hi> yielded his right, as we will relate in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>To sum up the pretences of the French upon <hi>Milan;</hi> They are grounded, 1. Upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of marriage of <hi>Valentina,</hi> who is substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:205314:69"/>Heir of the Dutchy, the lawfull Heires male failing; and the contract is valid, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope in the vacancy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. 2. The investiture given by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> in favour of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. and his Heirs; yea of <hi>Claude</hi> and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 3. The second investiture, <hi>an.</hi> 1509. 4. <hi>Francis the</hi> I. having yielded all his rights by the Treaties of <hi>Madrid, Cambray,</hi> and <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> as we shall see afterwards; one may say that (besides the nullity of that cession, by the right of the Kingdom) <hi>Francis</hi> may have quitted the right that came to him by his great Grandmother <hi>Valentina;</hi> but that hee hath not quitted that which came to his children by <hi>Claude</hi> his wife, who being daughter of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. had for her and her issue the right of investiture both of 1505. and 1509. which her Husband could not take from her. And <hi>Francis</hi> made use of this reason among the nullities which he objected against the treatie of <hi>Madrid.</hi> In what time these cessions were made, and of what strength they are, the next Chapter will shew.</p>
                     <p>The Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> had also some dependance from the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> That City with the Country depending from it, having shaken the yoke of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours (as the other Commonwealths of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:205314:69"/>
                        <hi>Italie,</hi> while the Italian and German Princes were contending for the Empire) form'd it self into a most flourishing State. In the Wars of the East, and Conquests of the <hi>Holy Land, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> was very considerable, no lesse than the <hi>Venetians and Pisans,</hi> possest many Countries in the Levant, the Ile of <hi>Chio,</hi> the Town of <hi>Capha</hi> upon <hi>Mar Major,</hi> in <hi>Taurica Chersone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and others. But the Commonwealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakned by the jealousies of two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Families, the <hi>Fregosi</hi> and the <hi>Adorni,</hi> the State submitted it self unto <hi>Charles the</hi> VI of <hi>France,</hi> an. 1390. who taking them under his Protection, sent to them the Marshall of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaut,</hi> who received their Oath of fidelity. But great confusions being risen in <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the weaknesse of <hi>Charles the</hi> VI. for 29. years, by the invasion of the English, and by the extremity that <hi>Charles the</hi> VII. was brought to, that right over <hi>Genoa</hi> was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. But in the year 1458. the same <hi>Genoese</hi> being opprest with their own divisions, sent <hi>Peter Fregosa</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Charles the</hi> VII. who received them under his protection, and sent them <hi>John Duke of Lorrain,</hi> eldest Son to the <hi>Duke of Anjou.</hi> And after <hi>Charles the</hi> VII, having again given themselvs to <hi>Lewis the XI,</hi> some Historians say, that he neglected that Conquest, so that they were forced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to <hi>John Galeas, Duke of Milan.</hi>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:205314:70"/>Others say, that <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI invested that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas</hi> in the Lordship of <hi>Genoa,</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing homage for it to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> And <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. passing to the Conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> invested against <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick Sforza</hi> in the same by the Treaty of <hi>Vercel, an.</hi> 1494, he paying <hi>thirty thousand ducats</hi> of entry, in consideration of the auxiliary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which <hi>Ludovick</hi> promist unto <hi>Charles</hi> for the Conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi> After <hi>Charles,</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Genoa</hi> remained subject to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Dukes of Milan,</hi> and <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII, made a triumphant entry into it, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them all the honours and deferences of Subjects to a Soveraign, <hi>an.</hi> 1502. and gave them a Governour, <hi>John of Cleves</hi> his Kinsman. But <hi>an.</hi> 1527. while <hi>Charles</hi> the V, and <hi>Francis</hi> the I, were in the heat of their quarrell, the City of <hi>Naples</hi> being besieged by <hi>Monsieur de Lautree, Andrew Doria</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> subject to the French King, and Generall of his Fleet, being ill satisfied of <hi>Francis the</hi> I, revolted from him, turned to the Emperour, and was the cause of the losse of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Emperour to win him to his service, offered him <hi>la carte blanche,</hi> that is, what conditions soever he would have. The first demand of <hi>Andrew</hi> was the liberty of his City, which he obtained, and it was freed from all subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Dukes of Milan.</hi> But if the French

                        <hi>Of the Counties of</hi> Flanders <hi>and</hi> Artois.</head>
                     <p>These two Counties were antiently before the conquest of the Romans, parts of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> and so under that Empire, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first and second race of the French Kings, till that famous partage of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> an. 843. when the River of <hi>Scaldis</hi> being set as a limit of that which belonged to <hi>Lothary,</hi> the Emperour on the one side; and <hi>Charles le Chauve</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Country remained within the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the last, who was King of <hi>France,</hi> and containes a great extent of Land beyond the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> near the Rivers of <hi>Scaldis</hi> and <hi>Lis,</hi> butting upon the Ocean. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all that Country was full of Wood, which made it be called <hi>Sylva Carbonaria, Charlemagne,</hi> about the yeare 771. placed there a Governour whom he called the <hi>great Forester of Flanders.</hi> So also were his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors called, and were not very considerable.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:205314:71"/>
                     <p>The first that erected this Country into a County, was <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> an. 850. or thereabouts. The first Count was <hi>Baldwin,</hi> surnamed <hi>Bras de fer</hi> or <hi>Iron-arm,</hi> for his great exploits against the <hi>Normans,</hi> then barbarous and infidels, who coming from the North, infested those coasts both by Sea and Land. This <hi>Baldwin</hi> stole away <hi>Iudith</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> and widow to an English King, which action at the first moved <hi>Charles</hi> to a great wrath and hatred against him. But <hi>Iudith</hi> having appeased her Father, and <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> being very necessary for the defence of those Countries against the Normans, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Kings Grace, and it was upon that reconciliation, that he was made Count of <hi>Flanders.</hi> So that <hi>Baldwin</hi> is the head of that house of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> which then were but one Province.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All that Country remained thus united in one County, till the year 1180. when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip August</hi> King of France, married <hi>Isabella</hi> Daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the IV. Count of <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> and of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Flanders.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to <hi>Margaret,</hi> to shew his joy for that high alliance, gave her the Country of <hi>Artois,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the Towns of <hi>Arras, Bapaume,</hi> Saint <hi>Omer, Aire, Hesdin,</hi> and some others which <hi>Philip August</hi> enjoyed, and his Sons after him,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:205314:71"/>till <hi>Lewis</hi> the VIII, gave the Country of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi> to his third Son <hi>Robert,</hi> for whose sake his brother St <hi>Lewis</hi> erected the same into a County, of which this <hi>Robert</hi> did him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and that house of <hi>Artois</hi> was a Royal house for a long time after. Thus <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> had their severall Counts and Lords, as most of the other seventeen Provinces of <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>King Iohn</hi> of France having given to his fourth Son <hi>Philip,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> because he loved him dearly, he procured a great marriage for him, marching him with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> only Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the III. Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Brabant.</hi> That Princess was held the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est match of Europe, for she was Heir not onely of the Counties of <hi>Flanders, Burgundy, Artois, Nevers, Retel,</hi> and other great Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, but was also apparent Heir (from her great Aunt by her Mothers side) of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of <hi>Brabant, Lothier, Limburg,</hi> and the <hi>Marquesat</hi> of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> That alliance made an. 1356. was the beginning of the greatness of the house of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> For that <hi>Philip,</hi> and his three successors, <hi>Iohn, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> united all these great States, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fell into the House of <hi>Austria</hi> by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as we have represented before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Although the propriety of those two
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205314:72"/>Provinces, <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> came to the House of <hi>Austria</hi> by the match of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with <hi>Maximilian;</hi> the pretences of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> upon that propriety, being quitted by the reddition of the Towne of <hi>Arras, an.</hi> 1435. Yet the soveraignty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath remained with the French Kings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Cessions by them made of the same by severall Treaties, of which the first was that of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That soveraignty is proved by seven Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The first is, The homages which the Counts have alwaies payed to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> for these Counties, and the investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they have taken from them of the same. The second, That the Kings of France have judged of the Counts of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> as Soveraigns, and given them Lawes. The third, That they decided of peace and war in <hi>Flanders,</hi> even against the will of the Counts. The fourth, That they have given grace to <hi>Flemmings</hi> as their Soveraigns, and punisht them of their rebellions. The fifth, That it was especially promis'd and agreed, that the Flemmings should resort to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The sixth, That the Kings of France have protected as Soveraignes, the <hi>Counts of Flanders.</hi> The seventh, That they have confiscated the County for Felony. Briefly, the Kings of France have exercised
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205314:72"/>all Acts of Soveraignty in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois,</hi> a thing never brought in question or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed before <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Empire, and fallen to great Wars against <hi>Francis</hi> the I. was delinquent in that duty, and obtained the cession of that right by divers Treaties.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is then a known truth, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> did belong to the Soveraignty of <hi>France,</hi> and that the question is onely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cession made at <hi>Madrid</hi> was just and valid. Upon which the French say,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Charles</hi> the V, being born a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of France at <hi>Gant,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> committed the crime of Felony by his Wars against his Soveraign, whom also he took and kept prisoner, which was often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided to him; yea a sentence of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> intervened against him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is deprived of his Lordships depending of the Crown of France for crime of Felony; so that being a Felon against his Soveraigne, he had no right either to treat with him when he kept him prisoner, nor any way oblige him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The cession made by the Treaty of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> was invalid by the Law of Nations, as done by a man kept in prison.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That cession made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaties, is null by the fundamentall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205314:73"/>Laws of <hi>France</hi> which prohibit the alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soveraign rights of the Crown, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially without the consent of the States Generall, who never ratified all those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And in effect, the Parliaments by their sentences, the Peers of the Kingdom by their Votes, and all the learned and judicious by their discourses have condemned those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And to this day the <hi>Flemmings and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> are accounted <hi>Regnicolae,</hi> and have no need of letters of Naturalization.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Wars, Agreements, Treaties, between the houses of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Austria <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their pretences, from the Treaty of</hi> Arras <hi>to that of</hi> Vervins.</head>
               <p>WE have seen how by the History, and by Reason, the two Houses of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi> will ground their several preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As the differences between private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons beget suits in Law, which end in the sentence of a Court; so the jealousies between these two great houses have begot Wars, which haue ended in Treaties: Yet so that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205314:73"/>the Wars have begun afresh after. These Wars have been many, especially since the promotion of <hi>Charles</hi> the V to the Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 1519. For the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who without contradiction had the precedence before all Christian Monarches were grieved to see a <hi>Count of Flanders,</hi> and an Heir of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> a small Province of <hi>Germany</hi> advance himself so far as to offer to step before them, and (as many think) to affect the Empire of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To understand all these Wars, Truces, and Treaties; the History must begin at the <hi>Treaty of Arras, an.</hi> 1435. For although these six houses, <hi>Austria, Burgundy, Hungary, Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Castilia,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> the limbes of that great <hi>Colossus</hi> of the now house of <hi>Austria,</hi> were then severall houses; yet that Treaty will serve to see how the house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is fallen into the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and how their greatnesse began. Here then let us say in brief, what Wars and Treaties have been between these two houses since the Treaty of <hi>Arras, an.</hi> 1435. to that of <hi>Vervins,</hi> 1598. We will divide this into many Articles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most remarquable dates, touching only the most principall points, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the rest to the generall History. 1. From the Treaty of <hi>Arras, Ann.</hi> 1435. to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> with <hi>Mary</hi>

                  <p>In all that time, which was not yet the time of the greatnesse of <hi>Austria,</hi> the French Kings had nothing to do with that Family, which in that period of years, enjoyed the Empire in the persons of <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick the</hi> III. They had also little to do with the Kings of <hi>Castilia and Arragon,</hi> which were then two severall States. But much they had to do with the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that greatnesse of <hi>Austria.</hi> Of which this is the summary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Philip le Bon</hi> after he had brought the State of <hi>France</hi> into great distresse, and given
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:205314:74"/>it for a prey to the English, to avenge the death of his Father. <hi>John,</hi> slain at <hi>Montereau Fautyonne,</hi> an. 1419; Finally being ill satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the English, was forced to agree with <hi>Charls the</hi> VII, who had killed his Father, which he did by the Treaty of <hi>Arras, an.</hi> 1435. whereby <hi>Charles</hi> gave to <hi>Philip</hi> what we said before, <hi>Peronne, Montdidier,</hi> and <hi>Roye,</hi> the <hi>County of Artois,</hi> the enjoying of the <hi>County of Bullen</hi> for his life, also all the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> redeemable with four hundred thousand Crownes, and promist to join to the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Mascon, Chalons, Langres, Bar sur Siene,</hi> and <hi>Auxerre</hi> for ever, reserving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of these jurisdictions to the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> This Treaty raised very much the house of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> After which, <hi>Philip</hi> was a loyall friend and servant unto <hi>Charles,</hi> and helped him to expell the English out of <hi>France.</hi> Neither did he meddle with the first falling out of <hi>Charles</hi> with his Son <hi>Lewis the Dolphin</hi> (who was since <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI.) which division was called, <hi>La Ligue de la Praguerie.</hi> And all the reigne of Charles nothing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable hapned between these two houses but that towards the end of <hi>Charles, Lewis the Dolphin,</hi> having withdrawn himself discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented from the Court, and lived a while in <hi>Daulphiné,</hi> When the King his Father would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205314:75"/>have apprehended him by the <hi>Count of Damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martin,</hi> he fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was received with great honour by <hi>Duke Philip,</hi> who assigned him the Town of <hi>Guenep</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> to keep his Court, where he lived six or seaven years, till the death of his Father, <hi>an.</hi> 1461.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now comes the reign of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI, who had so much to do with the house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but nothing with that of <hi>Austria,</hi> and little with that of <hi>Arragon and Castilia.</hi> Historians observe, that <hi>Philip Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles Count of Charrolois</hi> accompanied <hi>Lewis</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and were present at his coronation. And that <hi>Lewis</hi> at the first was very great with the <hi>Count of Charrolois;</hi> but that soon after that friendship was separated, by reason of the great antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their humours, and because while <hi>Lewis</hi> was retired into <hi>Flanders,</hi> they had been too much acquainted with one anothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which brought them to a mutuall contempt. Also, because <hi>Charles</hi> had a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that <hi>Lewis</hi> had plotted against his life, and because <hi>Lewis</hi> would have brought the <hi>Gabell</hi> (or impost of salt) into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which the Duke did oppose. Then the suddain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> for which <hi>Lewis</hi> payed the four hundred thousand Crowns, incens'd the <hi>Count of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:205314:75"/>very much. These were the causes of the great hatred between these two houses, which the house of <hi>Austria</hi> inherited together with the Estate. Hardly indeed could these two Princes agree; for <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, disobliging, and dissembled; and <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Charolois</hi> was peevish and arrogant, and followed no Law but his own will. That hatred brought forth the War of the <hi>publick good,</hi> as they called it, in which <hi>Charles</hi> had the better. That War ended in the <hi>Treaty of Conflans,</hi> whereby it was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted that the King should restore to <hi>Charles</hi> all the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long before, to enjoy them all his life, and that he should have the <hi>County of Guines</hi> for himself and his Heirs for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> was assisted by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI, and the said <hi>John</hi> sold or pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him the <hi>County of Roussillon</hi> for three hundred thousand Crownes. This is the ground of the claime of the French to that County.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Henry</hi> the IV, King of <hi>Castilia,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> being in War, because <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> maintained the people of <hi>Arragon</hi> against their King, and about some Towns, <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI was chosen Umpire, and went to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> where he saw the <hi>Castilian</hi> on this side of the River of <hi>Vodazo,</hi> and upon the Lands of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205314:76"/>
                     <hi>France.</hi> That enterview made them despise one another, for <hi>Henry</hi> was an ill favoured and ill behaved man, of little wit, and was altogether governed by the <hi>Count of Lodesme. Lewis</hi> used a short and coorse habit, and wore a little leaden, Our Lady, at his hat. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Count of Lodesme</hi> seemed ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the French. He crost the River in a boat, with a sail of golden cloath, and wore pomps garnisht with precious stones. Ever since that enter view, the two Nations have despised one another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. After the peace of <hi>Conflans,</hi> the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were renewed between <hi>Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Count of Charolois,</hi> because <hi>Lewis</hi> cozened his brother <hi>Charles,</hi> gave him <hi>Normandy,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently took it from him, banisht him into <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> far from the other Princes, with whom he was in League, and gave him a little Country under the specious Title of <hi>Duke of Guienne.</hi> This angred the <hi>Count of Charrolois,</hi> and increased his jealousies. <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> dieth <hi>an.</hi> 1467. <hi>Charles</hi> succeeds him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This new Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is much considered in <hi>France,</hi> by reason of his great Lands, and turbulent spirit. All his time hee was in Wars with the King, and brought the English into <hi>France.</hi> The King also did raise him Enemies, which his own rashnesse did
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:205314:76"/>multiply. He was defeated by the <hi>Switzers</hi> at <hi>Granson</hi> and <hi>Morat,</hi> and killed before <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, an.</hi> 1477.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After his death, <hi>Lewis</hi> took the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Provinces annext to it, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Charles</hi> the VII, to <hi>Philip le Bon,</hi> as a masculin apanage, with the Towns upon the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> was to hold all his life, not leave it to his heirs. He seized also upon the Town of <hi>Arras,</hi> upon which he pretended a right.

                     <p>Since the death of Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things hapned under <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. <hi>Mary</hi> inheritrix of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> whom her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had promist to many Princes, in the end was married to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> an. 1478. <hi>Lewis</hi> would have her for <hi>Charles the Dolphin,</hi> but he was but six years old, and she above fifteen yeares elder then he. That pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of <hi>Maximilian</hi> before <hi>Charles,</hi> was the cause of many evils to France.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The loss of all that <hi>Mary</hi> possest, which might have been united with France.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The increase of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> which began then to be jealous of France,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205314:77"/>which she was very far from before that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Great Wars and endlesse envy, by the neighborhood of these two great Houses. That marriage lasted but four yeares, <hi>Mary</hi> dying of a fall from her Horse as she was hunting; She left two children, <hi>Philip</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> Father to <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and <hi>Margaret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the jealousie risen between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi> by that marriage, and incensed by the revolt of the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> a great Lord of <hi>Franch County,</hi> they broke into open War, and the battel of <hi>Guinegast</hi> was fought, of which the event was so uncertain, that both parties ascribed to themselves the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> being dead, the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, especially the <hi>Gantois</hi> alwayes muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, would expell <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and dispose of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Children. They married <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Dolphin, and appointed for her portion the County of <hi>Artois, Franch County,</hi> and other Lands. <hi>Margaret</hi> was then but two yeares old, and <hi>Charles</hi> twelve. But <hi>Charles</hi> being married since with <hi>Anne</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of <hi>Britain, Margaret</hi> was sent back to her Father <hi>Maximilian,</hi> which was a new cause of jealousie betweene these two fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:205314:78"/>
                        <hi>Charles,</hi> was married to <hi>John</hi> Son of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Castilia</hi> whom she never saw: Then she was for the third time married with <hi>Philibert</hi> the II, Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> They say of her, that she was three times married, and dyed a Virgin.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The same year was the expedition of <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII, into <hi>Naples,</hi> against the house of <hi>Arragon.</hi> To that which we have said of that quarrel, this must be added. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> who was adopted by Queen <hi>Jane</hi> the II. and in the end expelled the house of <hi>Anjou</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> left <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his bastard, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he could lawfully doe it, because it was his own conquest.

                     </p>
                     <p>Although that House of Bastards enjoyed <hi>Naples,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> would say that it was by their toleration, becaus <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who had been adopted by <hi>Jane</hi> the II. had conquered <hi>Naples</hi> with the Arms, the Blood, and the money of <hi>Arragon,</hi> &amp; that he ought not to have left it to any but his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John,</hi> King after him of <hi>Arragon.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ch.</hi> VIII. fearing lest <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> Son to <hi>John,</hi> should disturb his conquest
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205314:79"/>of <hi>Naples,</hi> either to assist that Bastard House, or to make it his own conquest, restored unto him the County of <hi>Roussillon, gratis,</hi> upon <hi>Ferdinands</hi> promise, not to disturbe him, yea &amp; to help him; but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> broke his word with him. What was the right of <hi>Charles,</hi> was shewed before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> with great expedition past through <hi>Piemont, Milan, Pisa, Florence, Rome,</hi> got the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> without difficulty, and governed it without prudence, and instantly lost it by the ill behaviour of his Ministers, which got him the hatred of the <hi>Neapolitans.</hi> A league was made by the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> not onely to stay his conquests, but to stop his return, and destroy him in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Army of the league, was <hi>Francesco Gonzaga,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who gave bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the King at <hi>Fornova,</hi> which the King won with great glory. Being returned into <hi>France,</hi> he prepared to return into <hi>Italy,</hi> but dyed in that preparation.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Charles</hi> was about the conquest of <hi>Naples, Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was King of France, stayed in his County of <hi>Ast,</hi> and renewed his claim to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> possest by the usurper <hi>Ludovick Sforza</hi> the murtherer of his two nephews. As long as <hi>Ludovick</hi> kept good intelligence with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205314:79"/>the King, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> durst not attempt any thing against him. But after that <hi>Ludovick</hi> had made himself one of the league against the King; <hi>Lewis</hi> possest himselfe of <hi>Novara,</hi> a Town of the Dutchy, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently was besieged by <hi>Ludovick</hi> and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, excepting the Castle.</p>

In the birth of these two eminent powers, which have cost so much, blood and tears to the Christian world, before they had conceived that great hatred which was between them after; the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both sides met at <hi>Noyon,</hi> and this was called the <hi>Treaty of Noyon, an.</hi> 1516, where it was concluded, that <hi>Francis</hi> should yield all his rights in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> for a yearly pension of a hundred thousand Crowns. 2. That <hi>Charls</hi> then called the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, should marry <hi>Lovise,</hi> the eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Francis,</hi> instead of <hi>Renee,</hi> sister to the Queen <hi>Claude.</hi> 3. That the Archduke should restore the Kingdome of <hi>Navarra</hi> to <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to <hi>John d' Albret,</hi> or in defect of it that he should otherwise content him within six months. The <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Archduke</hi> swore that Treaty, and give the one to the other, the order of Knighthood. The King that of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the Archduke that of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> made an alliance for ever; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, promist to have an interview at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being dead soon after, <hi>Charles</hi> made hast to passe into <hi>Spain</hi> to take possession of his Estates, and neglected the Articles of <hi>Noyon,</hi> especially the restitution of <hi>Navarra.</hi>

                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:205314:83"/>4. Yet for three years after, nothing was stirred on either side, because <hi>Martin Luther</hi> having alarmed all <hi>Europe</hi> with his Doctrine, the Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the X procured a generall truce for five years among all Princes. But <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the Emperour being dead, <hi>an.</hi> 1519. and <hi>Charles</hi> being increased with the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Title of Emperour; <hi>Francis</hi> the I. conceived a great indignation, that a vassall of his should have been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him to the Empire, whcih he had been a suitour for with great earnestnesse; which jealousie would never suffer these two Princes to agree.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Each of them had a great Minister of State by their persons, <hi>Francis</hi> had <hi>Artus Gouffier, Sieur de Boissi,</hi> Great Master of <hi>France. Charles</hi> had been bred by <hi>Guillaume de Crovy Sieur de Ceures,</hi> whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. had recommended to him. These two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the misfortune which the ambition of these two Princes was drawing upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, resolved to meet to make a peace, and alliance for ever. <hi>Montpelier</hi> was the place chosen for that meeting. But as soon as <hi>Boissi</hi> was come, and began to treat with <hi>Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> he fell into a fever and died, leaving that great work imperfect, which no body since was able to finish.</p>

                  <p>By the death of the Emperour <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Charles</hi> was made possessour of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the <hi>Empire,</hi> being possest before of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of <hi>Burgundy, Arragon, and Castilia.</hi> A greatnesse which swelled his mind, and made him loose his respect to <hi>Francis.</hi> Hee complained that <hi>Francis</hi> had taken <hi>Claude</hi> from him, the eldest daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, which was promist to him. <hi>Francis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanded <hi>Navarra, Naples,</hi> and the homages for the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> took to be too low for the quality of an <hi>Emperour. Charles</hi> also complained that the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Patrimony of his Grandmother <hi>Mary</hi> was kept from him, and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> belonging to the <hi>Sforzas,</hi> and to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>The great fire of War which lasted forty years between these two houses, brake out upon a very slender occasion. <hi>Robert de la March</hi> Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> adjudgd by the Peers of his Dutchy, which pretend themselves to be Soveraigns, the Town of <hi>Hierges</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennes</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:205314:84"/>to the Prince of <hi>Chimay,</hi> of the house of <hi>Crovi,</hi> against the Lord <hi>d' Esmeries;</hi> to whom the Emperour gave a writ of relief, although <hi>Robert</hi> pretended the judgement of his Peeres to be Soveraign. <hi>Robert</hi> incensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperour, made his addresse to <hi>Francis</hi> the I, and offered him his service. The King received him courteously, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his subjects to assist him, not willing to break with the Emperour. But <hi>Robert,</hi> proud to have the protection of <hi>France,</hi> denounceth Warre to the Emperour, who was then at <hi>Wormes</hi> to pacifie the troubles rising in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> about <hi>Luther,</hi> and attempts to surprise some places in <hi>Luxemburg.</hi> But the Emperour presently seizeth upon the Estate of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prince, and constrains him to ask him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; reproaching <hi>Francis</hi> in an odious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for receiving his rebellious subject. About the same time, <hi>Francis</hi> upon the inexecution of the Treaty of <hi>Noyon (Charles</hi> refusing to make restitution of <hi>Navarra</hi> to <hi>Henry d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret</hi>) took the quarrell of that dispossessed Prince, and sent <hi>Andrew de Foix, Lord de Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parre,</hi> brother to <hi>Monsieur de Lautre</hi> into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra,</hi> where the French did some exploit at the first, but were soon repelled by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. <hi>Charles</hi> taketh that enterprise for an infraction of the peace between the two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though it was but a succour given to a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205314:84"/>confederate of <hi>France,</hi> to prosecute his rights. He makes great preparatives of war, makes <hi>Leo</hi> the X, break w<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>France,</hi> &amp; joyn with him promising that after the Conquest of <hi>Milan,</hi> he would give to the Church the Townes of <hi>Parma and Placentia,</hi> members of that Dutchy, to which the Popes had some old pretence.</p>
                  <p>Such was the origine of the first War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles, an.</hi> 1521. The first three or four yeares there were great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in <hi>Champagne,</hi> in <hi>Navarra,</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> In <hi>Tierasche</hi> the Emperour took <hi>Mouzon,</hi> and besieged <hi>Mezie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> which <hi>Anne de Mommorency,</hi> who since was Constable of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Chevalier Bayard</hi> defended bravely. And <hi>Francis</hi> took <hi>Bapaume</hi> and <hi>Landrecy</hi> from the Emperour, and gave him the Chase.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Navarra</hi> the French had advanced but little in the years 1519. and 1520. But in the year 1521. the <hi>Admirall of Bonnivet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Fontarabie</hi> and took it, and made <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur du Lude,</hi> Governour of the same, who being besieged a whole year by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, defended it with great valour, till <hi>la Palisse</hi> since Marshall of <hi>France</hi> made them forsake the Siege. But <hi>Frauget</hi> an old Captain being made Governour instead of <hi>Lude,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it basely to the Spaniards, for which he was degraded of <hi>Nobility.</hi> With this the French lost all <hi>Navarra,</hi> and never came into it since.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:205314:85"/>
                  <p>For <hi>Milan, Francis</hi> having given the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it to the Constable <hi>Charles de Bourbon,</hi> he removed him and gave it to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> of the house of <hi>Foix,</hi> a great Captain in the field, but an ill Politician in a State. Hee so misused the people of <hi>Milan,</hi> both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and by his brother the Marshall <hi>de Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun,</hi> and together was so ill assisted with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Court, that the Emperour had an easie entry into the Country. <hi>Milan</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and plundered by the league of the Pope and the Emperour; and the French expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the Dutchy. At which they say, that the Pope died for joy, <hi>an.</hi> 1621. Soon after the battell of <hi>la Bicoque</hi> was fought, which the <hi>French</hi> lost by the stubbornesse of the <hi>Switzers. Lautree</hi> being returnd into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Admiral de Bonnivet</hi> was sent to <hi>Milan,</hi> where hee did no better, and was forced to forsake all. In that retreat <hi>Chevalier Bayard</hi> was killed, <hi>an.</hi> 1523. These prosperities of the Emperour were much helpt, by the revolt of the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> 1522, who was incensed by the little account that <hi>Francis</hi> made of him, the incroaching of the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> and the Marshall of <hi>Bonivet</hi> upon his Office of Constable, by the Kings favour; the hatred of <hi>Lovise</hi> the Kings mother, and the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>du Prat</hi> against him; and the small justice which hee expected in a suit which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:205314:85"/>concerned almost his whole Estate. Being turned to the Emperours party, he helped him to conquer <hi>Milan,</hi> and to give the chase to the <hi>Admiral of Bonivet,</hi> past into <hi>Provence</hi> with the Imperiall Army, besieged <hi>Marseille,</hi> where he is repulsed by <hi>Renso de Cera</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Baron, and <hi>Philip de Chabot</hi> that kept it for the King. He repasseth the Alpes, and the King after him, who comming to <hi>Milan,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth presently the whole Dutchy, <hi>Pavia</hi> only accepted.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Francis</hi> is besieging <hi>Pavia</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Antonio de Leva, Charles de Bourbon</hi> brings Troops out of <hi>Germany</hi> to relieve it. The battell of <hi>Pavia</hi> is fought, where the victory being already on the Kings side, he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in person the Enemy which was retiring, and had no sooner overtaken them, but hee was taken by them, <hi>an.</hi> 1524. upon Saint <hi>Mathias</hi> day. <hi>Francis</hi> having been kept a while in the Castle of <hi>Pissigitun,</hi> is carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there kept Prisoner. His Kingdom labours for his deliverance &amp; for peace. This brought forth the Treaty of <hi>Madrid, an.</hi> 1525, where <hi>Gatinara</hi> Chancellour to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>John de Selva</hi> first President of <hi>Paris,</hi> who were the two learned among the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, disputed at severall times the rights of their Masters. <hi>Selva</hi> claimed <hi>Naples, Navarra,</hi> and the Soverainties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:205314:86"/>Gatinara</hi> claimed the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour then possest. In the end, the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> was made, where among other things it was concluded <hi>Febr.</hi> 14. 1525,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That within the 20. day of the month of <hi>June</hi> next, the King will put the Durchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> into the Emperours hands, with all the appurtenances and dependances thereof, and all that he holds of the <hi>Franch County.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2, That he shall renounce the Soveraignty of that Dutchy and County, and of the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he shall renounce all his claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Milan, Genoa, Ast, Doway,</hi> L'<hi>Isle, Tournay,</hi> and <hi>Hesdin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the King with all his power shal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that <hi>Henry d' Albret,</hi> forsake his claim to <hi>Navarra</hi> in the Emperours behalf; or if <hi>Henry</hi> refuse it, that the King shall not assist him with his forces.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                     <hi>From the Treaty of</hi> Madrid, <hi>to that of</hi> Cambray.</head>
                  <p>That period containes but four or five years, in which many considerable things did happen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The King is delivered out of prison, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his two Sons for Ostages, the <hi>Dolphin Francis,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> goeth to <hi>Bayonne</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> stayeth at <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme</hi> and <hi>Gognac,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Charles de Lanoy,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> to be present at the execution of the Treaty. But that Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy saw in short time three actions repugnant unto it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first that the King having caused the Articles to be read in presence of the States of his Kingdom, they told him that they were unjust, contrary to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lawes of the State; and that he was not obliged to observe them, although the King did protest of his willingnesse to see them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                  <p>Two things made these Articles unjust; 1. The right of Nations, whereby all Treaties made by one kept in prison, are accounted void as extorted by violence. 2. The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:205314:87"/>Lawes of the State, by which the King is alwayes a <hi>Minor,</hi> as for the alienation of the royal patrimony.</p>
                  <p>The second opposition to the Treaty in the presence of the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> was that the Deputies of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested before the King, that he could not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them without their consent, and refused to submit themselves to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The third, That he saw a league made at <hi>Cognac,</hi> for the expelling of the Emperour out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour having made himselfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to all Princes, to the <hi>Italians</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and going about to devest <hi>Francesco Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> from <hi>Milan,</hi> which he had conferred upon him after the battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> the Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the VII, King <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Switzers,</hi> the <hi>Florentines,</hi> make a league which was called the <hi>Sacred league,</hi> to deliver <hi>Italy</hi> from oppression, without naming the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who also in a scorn was invited to make one in it, upon condition that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the two Sons of France, suffer the Duke <hi>Sforza</hi> to live in peace, and give over the siege of the Castle of <hi>Milan.</hi> By that league the War was to be maintained with common charges. And because the Italian Princes might be afraid of the power of the French in Italy, no lesse then of that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:205314:87"/>King <hi>Francis</hi> was to renounce his right to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> in favour of <hi>Sforza,</hi> for a pension which should be arbitrated by the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not under fifty thousand Ducats. That the County of <hi>Ast</hi> should remaine to the King, with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Genoa,</hi> under the Government of <hi>Antonio d' Adornat,</hi> with the title of Duke, if he would subscribe to that league. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was to be put into the Popes hands, he paying for it sixty thousand Ducats of yearly pension. That league was publisht and proclaimed at <hi>Cognac,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Lanoy,</hi> to whom the King made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses for the inexecution of the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> shewing how he was disabled and declared <hi>Minor</hi> by the State.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Lanoy</hi> being returned into Spain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the War of the league begins in Italy, at <hi>Milan,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Naples.</hi> At <hi>Milan,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Generall of the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army, besieged <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> whom the league had taken in her protection. <hi>Sforza</hi> is constrained to surrender the Castle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Army of the league, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall whereof was <hi>Francesco Maria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Urbin.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> having taken <hi>Milan,</hi> goeth straight to <hi>Rome,</hi> takes it, and is killed in the assault. The Cardinalls are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned and ransomed.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:205314:88"/>
                  <p>At the same time <hi>Lautree</hi> was at <hi>Naples</hi> with an Army, and laid a strait siege to it by Land. And <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> with the Gallies of France besieged it by Sea. Yea, he won a battel by Sea, in which <hi>Moncado</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> was slaine. But being ill satisfied of King <hi>Francis,</hi> who denyed him the ransome of Prisoners, and used him with contempt, he turned to the Emperour, and relieved <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> with victualls by Sea. And <hi>Lautree</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after happening to die, the French lost all in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Emperour settled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in it with more power. He restored the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Sforza,</hi> and made him marry his neece <hi>Christina,</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Yet he cut off from that Dutchy the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which was made Soveraign at the request of <hi>Andrew Doria.</hi> He confirmed also <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> to the Popes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. While this War was in <hi>Italy,</hi> King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> made a league with <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> and both declared War against the Emperour, who having said to the Herald of France, that his Master was not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to declare Warre against him, till he had disingaged his faith and fulfilled his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which if he repented of, that he should return into prison to make a new Treaty.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Francis</hi> exasperated with these words,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:205314:88"/>declared in presence of all the Court, that he would satisfie the Emperour by a Duel, and sent him a challenge, saying, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour lied, if he said that he had broken his word. The Emperour, though he made a shew to answer the challenge, kept himself still to his answer, that King <hi>Francis</hi> was not in a condition to require satisfaction of him, till he had discharged his promise. So all these threatnings vanisht into smoak.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. While these Princes were thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, two great Princesses, <hi>Lovise</hi> the Kings Mother, and <hi>Margaret</hi> the Emperours Aunt, were labouring for an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By their meanes the Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> was made, which therefore was called the Treaty <hi>of Ladies,</hi> it was in the year 1529. By that Treaty a marriage was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours sister, widow to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and it was agreed that King <hi>Francis</hi> should pay two millions of Gold for the ransome of his Sons. And that he should disclaim all his rights to the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> and to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and (as some adde) to whole <hi>Italy,</hi> which is like enough, since the Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> changed nothing in that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> but that there was no mention of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>

But the secret and true reason was, that the Emperour had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to Duke <hi>Sforza,</hi> that this <hi>Merville</hi> was at <hi>Milan</hi> as a Spy for the French, which was true; yea he was a secret Embassadour, and <hi>Sforza</hi> had desired that he should not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly take the title of Embassadour, for fear of offending the Emperour. That murther of <hi>Merville</hi> broke the peace; for the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes to chastise <hi>Sforza,</hi> the Emperour also took arms to defend him. It was at that time that King <hi>Francis</hi> instituted a new form of Militia, which was called <hi>Legionary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour also was incensed by the alliance which the King had made with the German Princes Protestant (though perhaps that name was not yet in fashion) who being persecuted by the Emperour for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:205314:89"/>had their refuge to the French King, as the antient confederate of the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> for the defence of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Empire. These Princes were the Duke of <hi>Saxony, the Palatine, the Duke of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, the Duke of Wertenberg, the Lantgrave of Hesse.</hi> Yea, he lent a hundred thousand Crowns to the Duke of <hi>Virtenberg,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to him the County of <hi>Montbeliard.</hi> But that engagement was simulate, and <hi>Francis</hi> did very willingly assist the Enemies of <hi>Charles.</hi> These were the motives and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this War. Of which, these were the chief passages.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Francis</hi> to passe to <hi>Milan,</hi> demands of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> passage through his Country. The Duke denies it by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beatrix of Portugal</hi> his wife, sister in law to the Emperor, &amp; very partial for him. That deniall cost the <hi>Duke</hi> the losse of all his Lands, both of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> which the King took, and kept them till the Treaty of <hi>Chasteau</hi> in <hi>Cambresis,</hi> an. 1559. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that invasion was the right which <hi>Francis</hi> pretended in these States from his Mother <hi>Lovise</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> A little before that invasion, the Emperour seeing that thick cloud threatning <hi>Milan,</hi> himself returning from <hi>Tunis</hi> with a weary and broken Army, sends to the <hi>K.</hi> propositions of peace, &amp; many
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:205314:90"/>fair words. Yet he stood so stiffely upon the Treaties before, very advantageous for him, that the King would not hearken to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he would only protract the time till he had recrewted his Army. Besides <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Sforza</hi> being dead without children, at the same time the Emperour had seized upon the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> And it was reported, that he intended to bestow it upon a Sonne of <hi>Portugal,</hi> his wives brother. For these reasons these two Princes fall to action. The King conquereth <hi>Savoy and Piemont,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour fortifies himself at <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Emperour passeth into <hi>Italy,</hi> visits the <hi>Pope, Paul</hi> III, an. 1536, and in presence of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> inveigns against <hi>Francis,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all that past between them ever since they came to their States, reproaching him especially for joining with the Princes of contrary Religion in <hi>Germany:</hi> And offereth three conditions to the King to choose which he would. The first was to give the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Kings third Son, the <hi>Duke of Angoulesme,</hi> not willing to give it either to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> or to the <hi>Duke of Orleans,</hi> for fear (said he) of giving jealousie to the Italian Princes, if persons so near the Crown grew so powerfull in <hi>Italy,</hi> especially the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had lately married <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> which had some pretences upon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205314:90"/>
                     <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Urbin.</hi> If the King accepted that condition, he desired to know what assistance he would give him against the Turk and the Heretiques. The Emperours second offer was, to fight a Duell with the King, either upon the Land or in a Boat. That he left to the King the choice of the Armes; That the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished should give all his forces to secure the sitting of a Council, and to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Heretiques and Infidells. That the King should deposite the Dutchy of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and himself that of <hi>Milan</hi> to be the price of the Victory. The third offer was, that if the King refused these two conditions, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared mortall War unto him, till one of the two was made the poorest gentleman of his Kingdom. The King purged himself to the Pope by letters of all the Emperours accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The War grows hot in <hi>Piemont,</hi> an. 1536. Many exploits are done, <hi>Fossan</hi> is besieged by <hi>Antonio de Leva</hi> for the Emperour, and taken. The <hi>Marquis of Saluces</hi> leaves the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and turns to the Emperour, who enters into <hi>Provence,</hi> and besiegeth <hi>Marseille,</hi> but in vain, being defended by the Kings presence, and by the generosity of <hi>Ann de Montmorency,</hi> who since was Constable of <hi>France.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is beaten out of <hi>Provence.</hi> At the same time the Count of <hi>Nassau</hi> makes some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:205314:91"/>in <hi>Picardy</hi> for the Emperour, takes <hi>Guise,</hi> besiegeth <hi>Peronne,</hi> but is repulsed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jean Capell</hi> the Kings Atturney General, moveth the Parliament that a <hi>proces</hi> be made against <hi>Charles</hi> as Felon, and Traitor against his Soveraign, of whom he held the Counties of <hi>Flanders, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> in fee. The Court of Peers hereupon assembled decree, that <hi>Charles</hi> should be cited with sound of Trumpet, upon the frontier of his States, to appear before them. And he not appearing, he was condemned, and his Dominions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending from the Crown were confiscated. Presently after, the King tooke many places in <hi>Artois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1538. the <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the III. comes to <hi>Nice,</hi> where both the Emperour and the King met also; the Pope communing separately with each of them, for hee could not obtaine of them that they should see one another. Yet they concluded a truce for ten years. That meeting being ended, the King returnes into <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour into <hi>Spain,</hi> but seeth the King by the way at <hi>Acquesmortes;</hi> They confirme the truce, and are civill one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Shortly after, the City of <hi>Ghent</hi> being revolted, and having killed their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, <hi>Charles</hi> desireth <hi>Francis</hi> to give him passage through his Lands, which the King granted him. In that passage the Emperour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:205314:91"/>received all the royall honours. The King went to meet him at <hi>Chastellerant.</hi> In that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, the Emperour gave the King some hope to give him satisfaction about the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>An.</hi> 1641. the King sent <hi>Antony Rincot,</hi> a Spaniard that had taken sanctuary in France, to the Turk, and <hi>Caesar Fregosa</hi> to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Both were slain upon the River of <hi>Po,</hi> going to Venice by Boat. This murder was done by the order of the <hi>Marquess du Guast</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who hoped thereby to get their Papers and Instructions, but they had been sent to <hi>Venice</hi> another way. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess</hi> was accused and convicted of the fact by those that executed it, who were taken at <hi>Venice.</hi> Upon this the King breaks the truce of tens years. The Dolphin, who was since <hi>Henry</hi> the II, falls upon the <hi>Roussillon,</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Perpignan,</hi> but is repulsed with losse. <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> seizeth upon <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenburg.</hi> The Emperour on the other side makes a league with the King of <hi>England,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Picardie,</hi> besiegeth <hi>Landrecy,</hi> but <hi>Francis</hi> relieveth it, and driveth the Emperour from the siege: <hi>Barbaressa</hi> the Turk comes by Sea to the Kings help, takes the Town of <hi>Nice,</hi> wasteth those coasts of the Mediterranean sea, &amp; goeth away having done little good to the French, and ill satisfied of them, having
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:205314:92"/>given a great matter of obloquy against <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> to the Christian Princes.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Piemont,</hi> after many exploits on both sides, the famous battel of <hi>Cerisoles</hi> was fought <hi>an.</hi> 1544. and won by the French, the French Generall being the Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> the <hi>Marquess du Guast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, being sore prest by the Turk in <hi>Hungary,</hi> sends a Dominican Fryer, his Confessor to <hi>Charles</hi> to exhort him to peace; <hi>Charles</hi> is perswaded to it, and <hi>Francis</hi> also. Their Deputies meet at St. <hi>John des Vignes,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and begin a Treaty which soon after was concluded at <hi>Crespy</hi> in <hi>Valois,</hi> of which these were the chiefe conditions.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Kings se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, should marry the Emperours Daughter, or that of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Romans, at the Emperours choice within six yeares; and for her portion, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour should invest the said Duke with the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the County of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Charolois,</hi> or <hi>Franch County,</hi> at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours choyce likewise. And that upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture with one of these, the King should renounce all his claim to all the rest, and to the Kingdom of Naples. That till there were Children born by that marriage, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:205314:92"/>had before assigned the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> for the Ladies portion, he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his power the Castles of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Cremona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the King should restore to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all that he had taken from him on both sides of the Alpes; yet that he might retain the Citadels as long as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours kept the Castles of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That both the Emperour and the King should restore all that they had taken the one from the other, since the truce made at <hi>Nice</hi> by the Popes mediation.

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:205314:93"/>1. The Pope, <hi>Paul</hi> the III. had invested his Bastard, <hi>Peter Lewis Farnesio,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> which the Emperour had yielded to the Church upon the claime of <hi>Leo</hi> the X. without much examining the Popes right, onely because it had been so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted when the Pope and the Emperour united themselves to expell the French out of Italy, <hi>an.</hi> 1521. That investiture troubled <hi>Charles</hi> afterwards, who pretended, either that these Towns should remaine united to the patrimony of the Church, or that in case of alienation they should return to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now this <hi>Peter Lewis, Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> having made himselfe odious to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by his cruelty and impudicity, was slain by the people of <hi>Placentia,</hi> who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the Emperours protection. At the same time <hi>Paul</hi> the III, being dead, <hi>Jules</hi> the III, that succeeded him, maintained at the first <hi>Octavio,</hi> Son to <hi>Peter Lewis,</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> But soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repenting of that donation which he saw to be displeasing to the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, joyned with the Emperour for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing of <hi>Octavio,</hi> who put himself in <hi>Henry</hi> the II, his protection; and that King power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully assisted him both against the Pope and the Emperour, and was at such odds with the Pope, as to prohibit the bringing of any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:205314:93"/>money out of France to Rome. At which the Pope amazed, desired peace of the King, and desisted to oppose <hi>Octavio,</hi> yea and caused the Emperour to restore <hi>Placentia</hi> to <hi>Octavio,</hi> since which time <hi>Octavio</hi> and his successours have enjoyed <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> At the same time the King protected also the Prince of <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Before that time, <hi>an.</hi> 1545. the Emperour got a great victory over the Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany.

                  <p>The Constable of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in his way seized upon the Townes of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that the King being come to <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> was desired by them to return, because they were agreed with the Emperour. Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Germany, he took many Towns in <hi>Lutzenburg, Rochemars, Danvilliers, Ivoy, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon.</hi> And the Emperour towards the end of the year 1551. besiegeth <hi>Metz,</hi> so well

                  <p>The people of <hi>Siena</hi> fearing lest that <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Medicis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> should make himself Master of their Commonwealth, had put themselves into the Emperours hands ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that he would bring them in their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But seeing that he would bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the subjection of <hi>Cosmo,</hi> they called <hi>Henry</hi> the II, to their help, who gave them <hi>Blaise de Montlue</hi> for their Governour, who since was Marshal of France; in his Commentaries he hath described how that City was besieged. But in the end they were forced to submit to the <hi>Florentine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1555. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> resigned the Imperial Crown to his brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and all his other Estates to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the II. A Treaty of Peace betweene <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> was moved near <hi>Ardres,</hi> and perfected near <hi>Cambray, an.</hi> 1556. for ten yeares, and sworne by the two Kings <hi>Feb.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>But presently after the death of <hi>Jule</hi> the III. and the Pontificat of <hi>Marcel</hi> the II. which lasted but two and twenty dayes, the peace was broken upon the Election of <hi>Paul</hi> the IV. a Neapolitan of the house of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> allied to that of <hi>Melpha,</hi> which had alwayes been of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:205314:94"/>the French faction, and was odious to the Spaniards, who used all their power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his election; And when in spite of them he was elected, they raised two powerfull Families of <hi>Rome</hi> against him, the <hi>Columna's</hi> and the <hi>Vitelli's,</hi> who revolted against the Pope, being assisted by <hi>Philip.</hi> The King sends help to the Pope, so the Truce is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

                  <p>But at the same time <hi>Philip</hi> having marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> made his wife declare War to <hi>Henry</hi> by a Heralt of Arms, who spoke to the King himself at <hi>Reims,</hi> whence followed many various effects of war in <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> till the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable battell of <hi>Saint Quintin</hi> lost by the French, an. 1557. where the Constable was taken.

By the first Article of that Treaty the French King was to execute religiously all the Treaties made between <hi>Charles the</hi> V, and <hi>Francis</hi> the I.

The State of <hi>France</hi> being in trouble at the entry of this reign, by the great favour of the <hi>Guises,</hi> Unkles to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wife to <hi>Francis</hi> the II, and by the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> who took the Regency of the Kingdome to the prejudice of <hi>Antony of Bourbon,</hi> King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and first Prince of the blood of <hi>France</hi> after the Kings brothers, who being kept low, and all the house of <hi>Bourbon</hi> with him seemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>France</hi> of a Civil War. <hi>Philip</hi> the II con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that State of <hi>France,</hi> sent to <hi>Francis</hi> the II a letter which was read in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereby he said, that he had heard how some great men of <hi>France</hi> being ill satisfied of the Government establisht by him, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law <hi>Francis,</hi> threatned his State of a Civill War. That he <hi>Philip</hi> was ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:205314:96"/>all his Forces, and his life, to make him obeyed as his good confederate and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, remembring the good instructions, and the holy education which his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the V, had received from <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, his Guardian.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The house of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> being degraded from the rank it ought to have had in the Court, <hi>Antony King of Navarra</hi> retired into <hi>Bearn;</hi> and when the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the <hi>Prince de la Roche sur Yon,</hi> conducted the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> to her husband, he bore them company. Now because by the Treaty of marriage, that Princesse was to be delivered to <hi>Philip</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Duke de l' Infantasqua,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Burgos</hi> came to receive her in the Abbey of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> which was in <hi>Navarra.</hi> There King <hi>Antony</hi> protested that the Queen was not delivered upon the frontires of <hi>Spain,</hi> but in the heart of his own Kingdom, that none should believe hereafter that <hi>Roncevaux</hi> did belong to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <p>All this reign past among civill confusions about Religion, and scarce any dispute was between the two Crowns. Yea <hi>Philip</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht <hi>Charles</hi> many times with Forces to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:205314:96"/>his Protestant subjects. Only these things are to be remembred for our purpose.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. After the first peace with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, <hi>an.</hi> 1564, <hi>Charles</hi> made a progress a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Kingdom, and saw his sister <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Bayonne.</hi> There the Queen-mother had an earnest and secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Duke of <hi>Alba.</hi> It is thought they agreed about a mutuall assistance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, against the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Netherlands;</hi> for in that year 1565. they began to stir in those Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Spaniard. <hi>Philip</hi> assisted <hi>Charles</hi> with some Troops, which kindness <hi>Charles</hi> could not return, the fire being kindled in all the parts of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>An.</hi> 1566. two things were near to have made a breach between the two States. <hi>Bertrand de Montlue,</hi> whom his Father in his Commentaries calleth, Captaine <hi>Peyrot,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace in <hi>France,</hi> undertakes to make some conquest upon the Sea, comes to the Isle of <hi>Madera,</hi> subject to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and desiring to take water, is repulsed with Canon-shot, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he makes a descent into the Iland with strong hand, besiegeth the Town, takes it, but is slain in that exploit. A complaint is made of this to <hi>Philip,</hi> as Uncle to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as an infraction of the Treaty, in which <hi>Portugal</hi> was comprehended. <hi>Philip</hi>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:205314:97"/>incenseth <hi>Charles</hi> against his own subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, but the Admiral appeaseth <hi>Charles,</hi> shewing that it was but a mis-understanding among private persons.</p>
                     <p>Another businesse of that nature was that of <hi>Gourgues. Dominique de Gourgues</hi> was a Captain of <hi>Gascony,</hi> who in the Wars of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had been taken by the Spaniards, and ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in prison. To be avenged of them, he went to <hi>Florida</hi> in the West-Indies, besieged the Fort which the Spaniards kept there, takes it by force, kills or hangs all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then returnes into France. Of this, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> makes high complaint unto <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Gourgues</hi> was in great danger of his life; but he was protected by the Admirall of <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> a Protestant, and an enemy to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. He represented unto the King, that it was an Act of private revenge. Also, that a little before <hi>Melander,</hi> a Spanish Captaine, had expelled out of the same Fort in <hi>Florida, John Rebaut</hi> of <hi>Diepe,</hi> with five hundred French-men, whom he had killed or hanged every man with this inscription.</p>

                     <p>The wisest French Historians affirm, and so did <hi>Gourgues</hi> himselfe; That not any private revenge, but the desire to punish that horrible
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:205314:97"/>treachery and murther upon his Country-men, made him undertake and atchieve that high enterprise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1570. <hi>Charles</hi> married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princess, much beloved of her Husband. Shortly after <hi>Philip</hi> married another daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same Emperour.

                     <p>The same yeare 1590. King <hi>Henry</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>Paris.

                        <hi>An.</hi> 1591. King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV, besiegeth and presseth <hi>Roven</hi> very sore. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> returneth, and maketh him raise the siege. Before the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> came into <hi>France,</hi> he propounded two conditions to the <hi>Duke du Maine;</hi> the one, that he should put the Town of <hi>La Fere</hi> into his hands, which he did, and the <hi>Parmezan</hi> put a Garrison in it of four hundred Spaniards. The other, that he should press the assembly of the States of the <hi>League,</hi> to declare the <hi>Infanta</hi> Queen of <hi>France.

                     <p>In <hi>January,</hi> 1593. was the opening of the States of the <hi>League,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> extraordinary Embassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> declared his Masters zeal for the defence of <hi>Religion,</hi> desired them to chuse a Catholique King, and to preserve unto the <hi>Infanta</hi> of Spain, the right she had to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Upon which that famous <hi>Arrest</hi> or sentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Parliament for the maintaining of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law.

When they prest againe, that the <hi>Infanta</hi> should be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:205314:100"/>acknowledged Queen with such a Prince as <hi>Philip</hi> should name within two months, they were answered, that when the States had chosen a Catholique Prince, if he was not married, they would consent that he should marry the <hi>Infanta.</hi> But the hope which <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> gave at the same time to the party of the <hi>League,</hi> that he would come to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, destroyed all these designes of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and he was anointed King at <hi>Chartes</hi> in the beginning of the year 1594, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entred into <hi>Paris,</hi> whence the Duke of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> departed with the Spanish Garrison.</p>
                     <p>The same year The Duke <hi>du Main</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost <hi>Paris,</hi> and seeing the League falling to pieces, went to <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and asked suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of <hi>Ernest of Austria,</hi> Governour of the Country, who sent <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi> into <hi>France. Mansfeld</hi> takes <hi>la Capelle,</hi> and returns into <hi>Flanders.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> having laid the Siege to <hi>Laon, Mansfield</hi> returns, and in vain endeavoureth to make him raise the siege.

                        <hi>An.</hi> 1595. King <hi>Henry</hi> got his absolution from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. The Spaniards opposed it, representing <hi>Henry</hi> to the Pope as relapsed and impenitent; but <hi>Du Perron</hi> and <hi>d' Ossat,</hi> since made Cardinalls, overcame that party.</p>

                     <p>The year before, the Cardinal of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who since was <hi>Leo</hi> the XI. being in <hi>France</hi> to procure the execution of the Articles promist by the King when he received his absolution from the Pope, had been preparing his mind towards a peace with <hi>Philip</hi> the II. who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself very old and drooping to the grave, sought to leave his Dominions peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Son, who was but weak in body and mind. <hi>Henry</hi> also desired to give peace to his subjects, tired and exhausted with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Wars forty yeares together. So that Cardinall with the Generall of the Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, <hi>Bonaventure, Calatagirona</hi> a Sicilian, disposed both the parties to a Treaty. The
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:205314:102"/>place was chosen for it at <hi>Vervins</hi> in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 1598. where a perpetuall peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the two Crowns. And the Treaty of <hi>Chasteau</hi> in <hi>Cambresis,</hi> an. 1559. was confirmed with the restitution of places on both sides; And the frontiers between the two States, setled as they have been kept till the rupture of the year 1635.</p>
                     <p>There, upon the dispute for precedence of Embassadours, the <hi>Legat</hi> devised this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Hee sitting under a Canopy at the boards end, set the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> at his right hand, and after him the Embassadours of <hi>Spain, John Richardot,</hi> President of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of State in <hi>Flanders, John Baptista Taxis</hi> a Knight of the Order of Saint <hi>Jago;</hi> and <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is Verriken</hi> first Secretary of State in <hi>Flanders.</hi> At his left hand were the French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, <hi>Monsieur de Belliure,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de Sillery,</hi> of whom the first was over against the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and so preceded by one degree the first of the Spaniards.</p>

                     <hi>From the Treaty of</hi> Vervins <hi>to the death of</hi> Henry the IV.</head>
                  <p>After the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> the two States kept reasonable good intelligence. <hi>Philip</hi> the II. died in the time of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The first difference between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the III King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was about the <hi>Marquesat of Saluces,</hi> which <hi>Henry</hi> redeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who did nothing but by the order of the Councell of <hi>Spain;</hi> And
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:205314:103"/>the Spaniard would not suffer the French to possesse any thing in <hi>Italy.</hi> An exchange then was made of <hi>Bresse</hi> for the <hi>Marquesat.</hi> Herein <hi>Philip</hi> did nothing against the alliance. For the <hi>Duke</hi> having broken his word with <hi>Henry, Philip</hi> refused to assist him, and to be a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his perfidiousnesse, although the Count of <hi>Fuentes</hi> raised great forces to assist him.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1602. was the conspiracy of the Duke of <hi>Biron.</hi> It was believed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had a share in his designes. But the depositions of the witnesses against him, speak only of Treaties and Intelligences with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of the sharing of the State of <hi>France</hi> among the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Yet they said that <hi>Biron</hi> should have had the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy, Franch County, and Bresse</hi> under the protection of the King of, <hi>Spain. Fontanelles</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was convicted to have been one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours, for which he was put to death, was accused to have treated with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to deliver the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Tristan</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> into his hands. But <hi>Henry,</hi> who had no mind to break with Spaniard, would take no notice of that treachery.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards pretence for these secret plots against <hi>France,</hi> was that <hi>Henry</hi> assisted the Rebells of <hi>Holland</hi> with men and money. Which the Spanish Embassadour having
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:205314:103"/>complained of, he answered that the money which he sent to the Hollanders was to pay his debts, for monies lent to him during the civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>As for the French Souldiers that served the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he could not hinder his subjects to take party where they listed; and that some of them also served the <hi>Archiduke.</hi> Howsoever that assistance was so resented by the Spaniards, that they lost no occasion to stir disorders in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many things hapned in the yeares 1605. and 1606. which shewed the enmity of the Spaniard against <hi>France.</hi> As the Treason of <hi>Loste,</hi> Secretary to Mr. <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who had intelligence with the Ministers of <hi>Spain,</hi> and let them know all the secrets of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Councell. He was discovered by one <hi>Rassis</hi> a Frenchman, that had taken Sanctuary in <hi>Spain. Loste</hi> ran away, and in his flight was drowned in the River of <hi>Marne,</hi> so no more could be known of that Treason.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lady <hi>Marquesse of Vernuiel</hi> ill sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom she accused to have broken his promise to her, treates with the Spaniard, and inveigleth into her reason her Father <hi>d' Antragues,</hi> and her brother the Count of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> since Duke of <hi>Angoulesm.</hi> Their design was to retire to the Spaniard, and to make one day that Ladies Son a stone
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:205314:104"/>of scandall unto <hi>France.</hi> Being discovered, all three were convicted and condemned to death. But the King gave them their grace.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1605. the reliques of <hi>Birons</hi> conspiracy appeared in the Provinces of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gort Limousin and Querey.</hi> All was done under the name of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon.</hi> Whether the Spaniard had a hand in it or no, it was not known.</p>
                  <p>At the same time <hi>Mairargues</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Provence</hi> treated with the Spaniard to yeild <hi>Marseille</hi> unto him. He was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and taken conferring with the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Spanish Embassadour, and put to death. This passage was near to have caused a breach between the two Crowns, for the Embassadour of <hi>Spain</hi> expostulated with the French King, because against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his Secretary had been taken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison. The King justified the fact, saying, that he was found monopolizing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his State. Nevertheless all was suddenly appeased: Although at the same time another Treason was discovered, a plot upon <hi>Laucate</hi> by two brothers <hi>Luquisses,</hi> who had been won by the Governour of <hi>Perpignan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1608. <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. mediated a truce between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> At the same time the <hi>Morisco</hi>'s of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:205314:104"/>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> secretly implored his aide against the oppression of the Spaniards. But he sent them back, saying, that he would not be the first that should break peace, but that if he was compelled to make War, he might make use of their proffers.</p>

                  <p>A yeere before the Kings death an. 1609. <hi>John William Duke of Cleves and Juilliers</hi> being dead without issue left his succession dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable betweene the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> who said it was devolved to the Empire, and the children of foure sisters of that Duke married in the houses of <hi>Brandenburg, Newburg, Deuxponts,</hi> and <hi>Burgan.</hi> It was thought that the great Army which Henry had prepared a little before his death was intended to assist these Princes against the Emperour. It seemes the <hi>Queene Regent</hi> knew so much, for when the <hi>Archiduke Leopold</hi> had seized upon <hi>Juilliers</hi> after the Kings death She sent <hi>Marshall de la Castre</hi> to assist these Princes, to whom he caused luilliers to be surrendred. There the French had to doe with the house of Austria, of the German branch.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:205314:105"/>
                  <p>In the year 1612. the two Crownes were allied by the marriages, of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. with <hi>Anne</hi> daughter to Philip the III, and of <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> (who is now <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the IV) with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldest daughter of <hi>Henry the</hi> IV. And in the yeare 1615. these marriages were accomplisht at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi> The world was full of hope that this double alliance would strengthen the peace betweene the two Crownes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1616 the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> being in War one against another about <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Kings of France and Spain intervened to make them friends. And this was done without prejudice to the peace betweene the two States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valteline</hi> is a vally seated between <hi>Germany, the Venetians, the Dutchy of Milan, &amp; the Grisons.</hi> It was in old time a part of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or at least an appurtenance of the same. And was engaged to the <hi>Grisons</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. for foure hundred thousand pounds arrear, due to them for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the conquest of <hi>Milan,</hi> since which time it was subject to the <hi>Grisons.</hi> But the differences of Religion intervening and the Grisons being turned Protestants for the most part, <hi>Valtolina</hi> kept for the most part the Religion of <hi>Milan.</hi> Which made them desire to shake the yoke of the <hi>Grisons</hi> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:205314:105"/>returne under the subjection of <hi>Milan,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it by the Spaniards. So that <hi>an.</hi> 1619. the great revolt began, and the <hi>Valtolins</hi> expell the <hi>Grisons</hi> their Masters. Who had recourse to the protection of <hi>France,</hi> by whom they held that Countrey. King <hi>Lewis the</hi> XIII. sends <hi>Monsieur de Bassompierre</hi> into Spaine to <hi>Philip the</hi> IV. (for <hi>Philip the</hi> III. was lately dead) who granted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Treaty of Madrid</hi> that all garrisons of strangers should depart out of <hi>Valtolina,</hi> and that order should be taken for the maintaining of the <hi>Catholique Religion. The Duke of Feria</hi> having refused to execute that command, and the <hi>Valtolins</hi> unwilling to returne to the obedience of the <hi>Grisons. King Lewis</hi> exhorted the <hi>Switzers and Grisons</hi> to maintaine their rights, and sent them an Embassadour the <hi>Marquis de Coenures</hi> whom he made afterwards <hi>General of their army</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> of France, known by the name of <hi>Marshall d'Estree</hi> Then did the French and the Spaniards fight, yet without breaking the Treaty of <hi>Vervins</hi> because both acted for their confederates.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Vrban the</hi> VIII. having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Depositary of the principal places of <hi>Val olina,</hi> sent his nephew <hi>Cardinal Barbarint</hi> into France <hi>an.</hi> 1625. who not being able to make an accommodation, as pretending
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:205314:106"/>to deliver <hi>Valiolina</hi> from the obedience of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> war began in Italie by the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made betweene the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> against <hi>Genoa</hi> which was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the Spaniard. Thus these quarrels upon the by, came very neer to an absolute rupture betweene the two Nations. For at the same time some Spanish ships passing from <hi>Barcelona to Genoa</hi> and driven upon the coasts of <hi>Marseille</hi> were arrested by the <hi>Duke of Guise.</hi> Of which the <hi>Genoese</hi> complained to the King of Spaine, whose Councel irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with these wars, and with the taking of many places about <hi>Genoa,</hi> gave order that all French ships in the havens of Spaine, should be arrested, and all the goods of the French trafficquing in Spaine, seized upon. The Councell of France to bee even with them made two <hi>Edicts;</hi> the one to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all traffick with Spaine, the other to seize upon all ships of Spain, Portugal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and other places of the Spanish domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet onely by right of represalls and for restitution of the goods taken from the French.</p>
                  <p>War continued in <hi>Piemont</hi> all that while, till the winter of that yeare 1625, when the armies retired into garrisons. That winter <hi>Du F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:205314:106"/>Treaty of <hi>Monson in Arragon,</hi> whereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commission from his Master or his principall Minister of State the <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu</hi> (as it was pretended) he did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derogate to the right of the <hi>Grisons</hi> over <hi>Valtolina,</hi> making the <hi>Valtolins</hi> well nigh Soveraines, taking from the <hi>Grisons</hi> all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to refuse the Iudges and that forme of Government which the <hi>Valtolins</hi> would set up among themselves. That Treaty was disavowed by <hi>King Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> who commanded the Embassadour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Wherein so much tedious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction was used, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was in the end constrained to take upon him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Valtolins,</hi> and sent them the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rohan</hi> who there continued the war, even after the rupture between the two Crownes.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1628 <hi>Vincent the</hi> II. <hi>Duke of Mantua</hi> being dead, <hi>Charles Duke of Nevers</hi> the next heire male succeeded; but the Emperour made some difficulty about it because he was borne in France, and because he did not come personally to him to render his homage.

Howsoever this war hath produced many great exploits on both sides, in Germany, in Italy, in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in Spaine. And though the fortune of war have alternative successes, yet France had hitherto the advantage of that bloody game, having stretcht her dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> united <hi>Lorraine</hi> to the French Crowne, got many townes <hi>in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Artois, Perpignan and the County of Roussillon,</hi> and got a good footing in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> Besides <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which hath submitted her self to the Soveraignty of France. The greatest losse of the Spaniard is that of <hi>Portugal</hi> by the practices of France, whereby the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath lost <hi>Brasill, and the East-Indies.</hi>

            <head>AN APPENDIX To the foregoing DISCOURSE; <hi>Shewing the Dispute about the precedence at the Councell of Trent, betweene the Embassadors of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spaine.</head>
            <p>IT is certaine, that before the formation of that great <hi>Colossus</hi> of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> about the year 1520. the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were acknowledged the first of Christendom next to the Emperours.</p>
            <p>The pieces wherewith the greatnesse of <hi>Spain</hi> is made up, are Provinces most of them feudatary of the Empire, or of France, or of the Pope; all these lately gathered up. But France is of an ancient, entire, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent greatnesse.</p>
            <p>The Embassadours of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. had the precedence every where before those of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:205314:109"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> because he was Emperour. But in the year 1555. when he resigned that quality of Emperour to his Brother, and his other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and states to his Son, perceiving that his Son wanting the quality of Emperour, could not keep that preheminence, he used this artifice. A little before his retirement from the world, he recalled from <hi>Venice</hi> his Embassador, <hi>Francisco de Vargas,</hi> who being an Embassador of the Empire, had a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the French Embassador. Then after the resignation of his States, he sent the same <hi>Vargas</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> again, as Embassadour for himselfe and his Son joyntly, although in effect <hi>Charles</hi> being devested of his dignities, <hi>Vargas</hi> was Embassadour of his Son onely, hoping thereby to deceive the <hi>Venetians</hi> and others, by sending the same man. <hi>Vargas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence which he had before. To which <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minique,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lodeva,</hi> Embassadour of <hi>Henry</hi> the II, of <hi>France,</hi> made opposition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to the Senate, that <hi>Charles</hi> was no more considerable in the world; that when the Embassadours of the Emperour <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> should appear, he would yield to them; but that he would not yield to the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour of <hi>Philip,</hi> but in all occasions of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ceremony, visits, and the like, he would take the first place, till the coming of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:205314:110"/>Embassadors. The Senate fearing some ill issue of this dispute, gave order that the two Embassadours should not present themselves at the ceremonies of the Feast of St <hi>Mark;</hi> and so the matter remained unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided all the year 1557, by the irresolution of that Common-wealth, and the simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the French Embassadour. But in the year 1558. <hi>Francis de Novailles,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Acs,</hi> having succeeded that of <hi>Lodeva,</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dispute, and the Embassadours of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being come, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be maintained in his Rights, and to have the first place after the Emperours Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, and couragiously took it before <hi>Vargas;</hi> who seeing that the policy of <hi>Charles</hi> (who dyed at the same time) took no effect, and that he was considered onely as Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour of <hi>Philip,</hi> began to extoll his Masters greatness, and number his States and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties which he possessed in farre greater number then the King of <hi>France.</hi> Saying that these customs of honour and precedence, must alter according to the time. That his Master was the greatest King of the world; farre more able to assist the Common-wealth with Arms, Men, and Money, then the King of France. The Bishop of <hi>Acs</hi> stoutly resisted him, and obtained of the Senate an Order whereby the precedence was adjudged unto
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:205314:110"/>him above the Embassadour of Spain. About which, when the Spaniard expostulated very earnestly, it was answered him, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth would not undertake to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the greatnesse of their Majesties; but that they found in their Records, that in all Acts both publique and private, Ceremonies, Visits, and Audiences, the Embassadours of France had preceded those of Spain, and to that received custome they would keep. This answer offended <hi>Philip,</hi> who upon that called back his Embassadour. But <hi>Micael Surriano,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassadour in his Court, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the decree of the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> and in some sort mitigated the displeasure of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> who yet in all occasions renued that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>His greatest effort was four years after in the Councill of <hi>Trent.</hi> To understand the right of precedences of Ambassadours, we must know, that in the Councill there was three sorts of Assemblies; particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, generall Congregations, and Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. In the private Congregations, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors assisted with some Bishops, examined the questions of Faith and Reformation, and there no Ceremony of precedence was heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the general Congregation all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates assembled, the Legats were Presidents, every one kept his place of honour: It was a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:205314:111"/>publique action where questions were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Legates propounded that which was to be examined in the particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; every Prelate had right to speak and to vote; Embassadors of Princes had audience after their Commission was examined, and that which was to be promulgated in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Session was there concluded; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors kept their place there according to their rank. The Session was the solemne day, upon which after a Mass of the Holy Ghost, and a Sermon of a Prelate, or some eminent man upon the matter in question; the Prelate officiating, pronounced with a loud voyce the Decrees resolved, which the Fathers appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a <hi>Placet.</hi> In these Sessions, Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had also their place of honour, and at the Mass: That honour was seen by the place where they sate, by the <hi>Censer,</hi> and by the <hi>Pax,</hi> which was given them in the time of the Mass. Now whereas this Councill was held at three severall times, under there several Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> the III, <hi>Jule</hi> the III, and <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. In the time of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Jule, Charles</hi> the V, was Emperour, whose Embassadors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction sat above the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, who in the sixteen first Sessions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very little, and no place was held there under the title of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet some things hapned then which shewed the eminency of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:205314:111"/>the French Kings above all others, next to the Emperour. In the Bull of the Indiction of the Councill <hi>Paul</hi> the III, dated <hi>an.</hi> 1542. the King of France is named after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in express terms, and all the other Princes comprehended in one generall term, and that twice. Thus, <hi>Charissimos in Christo filios nostros, Carolum Romanorum Imperatorem, &amp; Christianissimum Regem Franciscum, duo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipua Christiani nomins firmamenta atque fulcra orare atque obsecrare institimus.</hi> A little lower. <hi>Supra autem dictos, Imperatorem Regemque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianissimum, nec non caeteros Reges, Duces, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes quorum praesentia si aliàs unquam, hoc qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tempore maximè, sanctissimae Christi fidei &amp; Christianorum futura est salutaris, rogantes atque obsecrantes per viscera misericordiae Dei,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Council, an. 1545. <hi>Francis</hi> the I, had appointed for his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, <hi>Claude D'Ursé Seneschal of Forests, Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques de Liguieres, Prefident in the third Chamber of Enquests in the Parliament of Paris, and the Deane, Peter Danes, since Bishop de la Vaur.</hi> But being informed by some French Bishops that were at <hi>Trent,</hi> that there was little hope that the Councell should do any good, he called back his Embassadors who did not appear in the Councel. <hi>Antony Filioly</hi> of <hi>Ganat,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> was there for the King who in the first Session, when publike prayers
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:205314:112"/>were made for the Princes, having required that the King of France should be named in expresse termes, as he had been named in the Bull of the Indiction, the Legats eluded that demand, and said, that the Fathers ought to be consulted about it, and none was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in expresse termes but the Pope and the Emperour; all other Princes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in one generall term.</p>
            <p>In the year 1546. <hi>Francis</hi> the I, sent his Embassadour <hi>Peter Danes,</hi> Bishop <hi>de la Vaur</hi> to the Councill; At his reception, he made a fine speech, wherein he represented the State of Christendom, and the great disorders crept into the Church, even into the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> At which when a certaine Bishop did laugh, saying, <hi>Gallus Cantat. Danes</hi> replyed readily, <hi>Utinam isto gallicinio, Petrus ad resipis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiam &amp; fletum excitetur.</hi> An Apophthegm which afterwards was rife in the mouth of the Fathers of the Councill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1547. when <hi>Paul</hi> the III, to avoid the plague &amp; the war of <hi>Germany,</hi> would remove the Councill from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolonia;</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates consulting the Fathers about it, said that his Holinesse approved of it, <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato etiam consilio cum Imperatore, Christianissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Rege, &amp; aliis Regibus ac principibus Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> which is another expression of the honour which the Concil did to the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:205314:112"/>
            <p>But in the third Indiction of the Councill under <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. <hi>an.</hi> 1561, in the Bull of the Indiction, <hi>Pius</hi> the IV, useth other words then <hi>Paulus</hi> the III, and <hi>Julius</hi> the III, had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before. Thus, <hi>Charissimos verò in Christo filios nostros Romanorum Imperatorem electum, caeterosque Reges, &amp; Principes quos optandum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè esset Concilio interesse posse, hortamur &amp; roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> without any mention of the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King. <hi>Philibert de la Bourdesiere,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Angoulesm,</hi> Embassadour of <hi>France,</hi> in the Popes Court expostulated with him by the Kings order for that neglect, with protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that notwithstanding that neglect, he would not hinder the progress of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill; yea, that he had commanded his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to go to the Councill. The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he had charged some Cardinals to form the Bull, and that they had not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Pointillo;</hi> and that after they had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Emperour, they had not judged it necessary to name all the Kings, but had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them under one generall name. The Embassador replyed, that it was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> not to be comprehended under a generall name. The Pope answered, that he could not foresee all things, and that another time order should be given, that the like errour should not be committed.</p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:205314:113"/>
            <p>In the year 1562, the 18. of <hi>May, Lewis de Saint Gelais, Lord de Lansac,</hi> came to <hi>Trent,</hi> and three dayes after, <hi>Arnault Ferrier, Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Enquests of Paris, and Guy du Faur de Pibrac,</hi> chiefe Judge of <hi>Tolosa,</hi> sent by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who were received with great honour by the Council; yea great part of the Prelats subjects of the King of Spain went to meet them. But <hi>Ferdinand de Avalo, Marquess of Pesquera,</hi> Embassadour to King <hi>Philip,</hi> went out of <hi>Trent</hi> three dayes before, and retired to <hi>Milan,</hi> of which he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, pretending a feare from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of <hi>Daulphiné</hi> and the <hi>Switzers,</hi> but in effect to avoid meeting with the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, who took their place in the general Congregation after the Imperiall Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. <hi>Pibrac</hi> made a fine Oration, wherein he spake very freely against the disorders of the Church, the small progress of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill in such a long time, and for the liberty of voting in the Councill, which was not to be expected from <hi>Rome.</hi> He was seconded by the two other Embassadors, <hi>Lansac</hi> and <hi>Ferrier.</hi> The Pope complained of it, and said that the King of <hi>France</hi> had sent not Embassadors, but Advocates of the <hi>Hugenots.</hi> And indeed the ill opinion which the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill had of the beliefe of these three men was a cause why the Councill and the Pope dealt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:205314:113"/>with them with more rigor. In the meane while the French Bishops came to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, conducted by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who was most honourably received by the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the other Legates.</p>
            <p>Soon after the coming of the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain, Philip</hi> the II, having called back the Marquesse of <hi>Pesquera,</hi> sent to <hi>Trent</hi> another Embassador, <hi>Ferdinand Quigones, Count de Luna,</hi> who being gone to Germany before, to be present at the Coronation of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> would know of the Fathers of the Councill, what place they would give him. Upon which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the first Legate, having consulted with the Embassadours of <hi>France,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them this accommodation, that as for them they should keep their place next to the Embassadors of the Emperour, and that some other place might be found for the <hi>Count of Luna,</hi> over against the Legates on the other side, or after the Ecclesiastical Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, or in some other place out of the bench of the Embassadors. To which the French answered, that they were sent by their King not to judge causes, or to decide of the Rights of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was a good friend &amp; brother in law to their King, <hi>Charles</hi> the IX: but if any would take their place,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:205314:114"/>they were resolved to stand for it against all sorts of persons; which if the Councill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, they had order to withdraw with all the French Prelates, and to protest of the nullity of the resolutions which should be taken in their absence. To which the <hi>Legate</hi> answered nothing. That declaration of the French, though generous, gave occasion to the affront which soon after was offered to them in the Councill; for they are censured by posterity, for not requiring absolutely that the Spaniards should sit under them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1563. The Legates fearing some divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Doctors about their order in speaking, gave order that without distinction of Nations, every one should speak according to his seniority of Doctorship. But because some among the French Divines had the seniority over the Spanish; these made great complaints to the Legate, pretending that this preference of the French, would be a prejudice against the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which the <hi>Count de Luna</hi> was forming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the French Embassadours. The Legats rebuked them, shewing that the Doctors, though sent by the Princes, did not represent their persons as the Embassadors did: and that the question was onely of the seniority of the degree, not of the preference of the Nations. Notwithstanding these satisfactory
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:205314:114"/>Reasons, the Spaniards were angry, and threatned the Councill of their Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, who should take off his protection from them.</p>
            <p>The French seeing that the Spaniard stood upon points in such a clear business, and that of Doctors they would make Embassadours, did obstinate themselves also to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference even in the disputes of the Divines. And because the Popes delegates spake first without contradiction, the French asked to be admitted to speak next after them, which the Legates were constrained to grant: and it was decreed, that after the <hi>Jesuite Salmeron,</hi> the Popes Divine <hi>Nicolas Maillart</hi> Dean of the faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> should speak; and that after that, all should speak according to the seniority of their degree, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet to content the Spaniards, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Register of the Councill, that the French Doctor had spoken the first by the right of his seniority in the degree of Doctor, not by the preference of his Nation.</p>
            <p>The same year 1563. upon Easter-day, the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> was received at <hi>Trent,</hi> and in his entry mached between the Embassadors of the Emperour, and of France. This Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony past with much honour and civility between the two Nations. And at the same time, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> writ to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:205314:115"/>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (who was at <hi>Insprugh</hi> in the County of <hi>Tirol,</hi> three dayes journey from <hi>Trent</hi>) upon divers affaires of the Councill: and in the end of the Letter, desired him to find some temper to lay down the dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preference between the two Crowns, so that it might not appear in the Councill. But his Country-men blamed him for it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ought not to have taken notice of a dispute so ill grounded: Or if he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it, it should not have been to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a temper, but to maintaine his Kings right. The Emperour answered him, that it belonged not to him to decide the disputes between the Kings of France and Spain; but since he had desired him to speak his sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, if your Embassadours (said he) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their rank after mine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that none take that place from them; what does it import you what place be assigned unto the Spaniards? A verdict ill taken by the <hi>French,</hi> who held it to be of a dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For in an order of sitting, who so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his place (say they) is thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise it, and to ask a higher, which cannot be done without moving a dispute against those that sit in a higher seat.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Count of Luna</hi> after that solemn entry, was hidden forty dayes, and appeared not in any ceremony of publique action, being in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:205314:115"/>great perplexity how to behave himself; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he had a mind to enter into the assembly in the midst of the two Embassadors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror, who were injoyned to bear him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and after they had taken their place, stand by them till his Commission had been verified by the Councill, and then retire to his house. But considering that this would not be a generous maintaining of his Masters honour, he made means that the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors should be desired not to appeare in the Assembly that day; which being denyed him, he sent some Spanish Bishops to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to propound unto them, that the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Embassadors of Princes, should not enter into the generall Congregations but the day of their reception, but should content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be present at the Ceremony, the day of the Session, maintaining that it had been so observed in the Councells before. But all the Embassadors of Princes having opposed that motion, he could obtain nothing. Again, he caused some Bishops to propound some point to the Congregation, at the discussion whereof, the <hi>French</hi> ought not to be present as interessed parties; for example, to represent what damage would result to the whole Church by a peace of the King of <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> or some such thing. But all that being rejected, and the Congregation being
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:205314:116"/>put off from day to day by his obstinacy; in the end that the businesses of the Councell might not be retarded: the Cardinall of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> and the French Embassadors declared to the <hi>Legates,</hi> that if they might keep their place immediately after the Emperours Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, they did not care what place the Embassador of <hi>Spain</hi> should take.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> to this day exclaim against that action of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, saying that it was a great weaknesse, and that they had betrayed their Masters ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Yea, the Fathers of the Councell dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked it. And when the <hi>Cardinal de la Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiere,</hi> Resident for the King of France by the Pope, complained to him of that Spanish ambition, and novelty introduced against all ancient orders: the Pope (it was <hi>Pius</hi> the IV.) answered, that he should complaine to the French Embassadors, whose weakness he condemned, saying, that although he had been solicited before and after the entry of <hi>Count de Luna</hi> into <hi>Trent,</hi> to favour that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe he had remained constant and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that he wondred how the French had so easily, yea so freely yielded.</p>
            <p>The day of the Congregation being come, and each Embassador having taken his place, the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> enters, stands over against the Legates, somewhat far from the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:205314:116"/>seat, presents his Orders, and declares his Masters will. Then he protested, that although the first seat was due to him next to the imperiall Embassadors, as represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatest Prince of Christendome, the greatest Prop of the Church &amp;c. yet that he should bring no confusion to the affaires of the Councell, he desisted from that right; upon condition that this his protestation should be inserted into the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; so that they could not be printed, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise publisht without it; and that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py signed by the Legates should be given him by the Secretary of the Councill. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said these words, he went to take his place appointed for him, near the Table of the Secretary of the Councell.</p>
            <p>The French Ambassadors sitting by the Imperial, answered, that if it was thought that the place where they sat was not the most honourable next to that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as it had been acknowledged in all the Councell before, the last of which were that of <hi>Constance,</hi> and that of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the X; Or if the place assigned to <hi>Count de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> might be a prejudice against them, they desired the Councell to prevent it speedily by orders, commands, excommunications, or other wayes, practised in such a case without acception of persons. But because none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:205314:117"/>any thing, and the Imperial Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors connived to that novelty (although their interesse was to hinder it, least their place should be once disputed) they added: That without injury to the honour of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the alliance betweene the two Crowns, they protested against that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as unjust, requiring that their protestation should be inserted in the Acts of the Council, and that a Copy of the same should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them.</p>
            <p>None of the Fathers spake one word upon these disputes. And the silence was broken by a Spanish Doctor called <hi>Frontidon,</hi> who made a Latin Oration in the name of <hi>Count de Luna,</hi> whereby he exalted the greatnesse of the King of Spain, his zeal towards the Church and Religion, with such impertinent words, &amp; so much contempt of other Princes, that the Embassadors of the Emperour made great complaints about it to <hi>Count de Luna,</hi> who had no other shift to excuse it, than say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Oration had displeased him more then any.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Promoter</hi> of the Councell having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Oration, suddenly the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Spain went out of the Assembly, not expecting the rising of the Legates, to avoid a dispute with the French, and the same he observed in the following Congregations,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:205314:117"/>sitting by himself and going out alone.</p>
            <p>But that Order could not be kept in the Church the day of the Session, because the manner of sitting there was not alike, and some more precise ceremonies were used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preference, as that of the <hi>pax,</hi> and the <hi>censer</hi> at the Masse. Wherefore the <hi>Legats</hi> consulted the <hi>Pope</hi> before the Session, and he being won by the Spaniards, thinking that the French would again run into another weaknesse, writ to the <hi>Legate</hi> that in the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they should assign a place apart to the Spaniard, and that the <hi>pax</hi> and the <hi>censer</hi> should be given to both the Ambassadours at the same time; but that the businesse should be kept secret till the point of the action, that the French might not storm at it.</p>
            <p>The day of the Session being come, which was Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day, the 29. of <hi>June,</hi> after the Bishop of <hi>Valdaosta</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> had begun the Masse of the Holy Ghost, presently a Chair of black Velvet was brought out of the Vestry, which was placed between the last Cardinall and the first Patriarck, where <hi>Count de Luna</hi> sate. The <hi>Cardinall of Lorrain</hi> with the French Ambassadours, made a great noise about it, and rose to withdraw, when at the same time they heard the order given about it, and for the <hi>Censer</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pax.</hi> But for fear of troubling the action, they contented
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:205314:118"/>themselves to protest against it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that their Masters right did not consist in the equality, but in the precedence. The Gospell being read whilst a Divine went up into the Pulpit to make a speech, the Legats with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the other Cardinalls, the Ambassadour of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>Ferrier</hi> one of the French Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours went into the Vestry; into which they called the Archbishop of <hi>Granada,</hi> a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and two French Bishops to find some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. After many disputes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goings and commings and messages to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> it was concluded that the Masse should be ended without receiving the <hi>Censer</hi> and the <hi>pax.</hi> After which, <hi>Luna</hi> came out of the Church with his Spaniards triumphing for that first step so advantagious to his Master.</p>
            <p>This action was very scandalous to the French; and the Legats not able to bear the envy of it, were constrained to produce the command which they had from <hi>Rome</hi> about it. The injury was more resented, because it was done to a King in his minority (it was <hi>Charles</hi> the IX) and one that was afflicted with Hugonots, and entangled in a civill War. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> writ very smart letters to the Pope about it; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the respect due to him. But <hi>Ferrier</hi> a violent and stout man, cryed out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:205314:118"/>where, that unlesse at the next publique Mass the preference of the <hi>Censer</hi> and the <hi>Pax</hi> was given to his Master he would protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, not against the Legats, who had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Popes Orders, nor against the Councel, whose hands were manifestly bound, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>Philip,</hi> who took his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage where he might, nor against the Roman Church, toward which he should never lose the due respect, but against the very person of the Pope, whom he would prove to have bought the pontificat, and would appeal from him to a lawfull Pope, and to a true and free Councel. And that his Master would cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a Nationall Councel, as numerous and as Generall at that of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is certain that <hi>Ferrier</hi> &amp; <hi>Pibrac</hi> (for Lansac was returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi>) had prepared a most bloody speech against the Pope, and against that innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ferrier</hi> was to pronounce it, and at the same time command all the French Bishops and Doctors to leave the Councell, with a promise to return whensoever God had given a lawfull Pope to his Church, and restored to the Councels their antient and full liberty. The speech was printed, but not pronounced. <hi>Ferrier</hi> spread it among the Fathers, because <hi>Count de Luna</hi> boasted that the Legats had promist him that at the first Mass hee should be admitted to the equality of the <hi>Pax</hi> and <hi>Censer.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:205314:119"/>
            <p>The Legates fearing, lest this quarrell should come to some sad issue, because the Ambassadour of <hi>Poland</hi> declared, that if the King of <hi>France</hi> should depart from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Councel, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would soon do the like, and many other Princes; The Legates I say, and the wisest of the Council, especially <hi>Madruvio, Cardinal of Trent,</hi> of the Imperial party, thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that thereafter publique Masses should be said without the <hi>Pax</hi> and the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi> and made <hi>Count de Luna</hi> approve of it. And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hearing all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, thought he had got a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But the Pope lost by it, for the affront done to the French in that Councel hindred the Publication of it in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after, the <hi>Cardinal of Lorrain</hi> retired to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> declaimed in a general Congregation against abuses and disorders crept into the Church, and spared no body. The Pope was much displeased at it, and to allay that heat, sent the <hi>Cardinal of Lorrain</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> with full authority to regulate all with the Legats. He was present at the 24th Sossion held <hi>November</hi> 11. 1563. which is of the Sacrament of marriage. And having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived order from <hi>France</hi> to return without delay with all the French Bishops, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates hasted to make an end of the Councel,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:205314:119"/>and held the 25<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Session which was the last upon the 3d. and 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> in which Session, as in the precedent, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours kept their place. <hi>Luna</hi> sate by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Councel. In the publique Mass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es neither <hi>Pax</hi> nor <hi>Censer</hi> was used. So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ended the 4th. of <hi>Decem.</hi> 15 63. &amp; the <hi>Cardinal Moron,</hi> at that time the first President, giving his blessing to the Fathers, told them <hi>Post gratias Deo actas Reverendissimi Patres, Ite in pace.</hi> And all answered, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because it was the custom at the end of the Council, to make acclamations to bless the Popes that had assembled it, the Fathers that had held it, and the Princes that had assisted it, and protected the Church; the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took himself the care to make them, and to pronounce them also; Which he was blamed for, as taking upon him that care which less becoming his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and more fitting for Deacons, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motors, Secretaries, and Masters of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Especially he was blamed because in the acclamation made for the secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he forgot to name expresly the King of <hi>France,</hi> which had been observed in the Bull of the Indiction, as we said before, and the omission whereof in the calling again of the Council by <hi>Pius the</hi> IV, had caused so much discontent and expostulation. Of this the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:205314:120"/>Cardinal could not be ignorant, nor pretend forgetfullnesse; since those acclamations were meditated and written down.</p>
            <p>There was two acclamations, the first for the memory of the dead, in which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal forgot to expresse the names of <hi>Francis the</hi> I. <hi>and Henry the</hi> II, who had contributed their care and their zeal for the good of the Council. The second was for the Princes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, where he forgat <hi>Charles the</hi> IX, who had sent his Ambassadours &amp; his Bishops to <hi>Trent.</hi> So he forgot both the dead and the living. That omission was objected to the Cardinal in the Kings Councel. He excused himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fear he had to make a division be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, King <hi>Charles</hi> being yet in minority, in danger of a civil War, and of the disorder which <hi>Germany</hi> was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon the quarrell of Religion; Whereby the King might have need of <hi>Philip,</hi> whom therefore he would not provoke or incense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that weakness which the Cardinal and the French Ambassadours shewed in the Congregations, Sessions, and Acclamations, having not with vigour enough defended the right of their Masters, was defended by them with plausible reasons; but, in effect, they opened the gate to the pretences which the Spaniards form at every meeting of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:205314:120"/>Assemblies, Processions, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, against the French Ambassadours, who hitherto have stoutly defended their right. At least they have kept the two essential points of precedence, which are; first, never to have left their place, either second, when the Ambassadours of the Pope and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were present, or first, when they were absent. The other, never to have suffered or done any action which may be interpreted to give an equality to the Spaniard with them. As for the order of sitting, which should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Spaniard to sit under the French; one can not take him by the hand to bring him to an Assembly when he pretends sicknesse or businesse. But if he appear in a publique meeting, the French suffers him not to use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action either of preference or equality.</p>
            <p>Since the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous meeting of the two Kings in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Ambassadours, or rather the only, was that of <hi>Vervins,</hi> an. 1598. where the French had the precedence, as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
